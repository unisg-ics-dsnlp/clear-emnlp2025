Keeping animals in zoos,essay080.txt,"
Since their inception, zoos have sparked intense debate, with proponents highlighting their entertainment and ecological value, while critics argue that captivity is inherently unjust. This discussion will weigh both perspectives before reaching a balanced conclusion.

Firstly, critics of zoos contend that keeping animals in captivity is unethical, as it denies them their right to freedom and natural environments. This concern is exacerbated in many developing country zoos, where inadequate care, insufficient nutrition, and subpar medical treatment are prevalent. Additionally, relocating animals from warm climates to colder regions, such as European winters, poses significant welfare risks.

On the other hand, zoo advocates argue that these institutions offer dual benefits: public entertainment and ecological balance. Zoos provide a unique platform for people, especially children, to engage with and learn about diverse animal species. The educational resources available at zoos foster a deeper understanding of animal life, while their conservation efforts play a crucial role in preserving endangered breeds. By replicating natural habitats and safeguarding vulnerable animals from predators and hunters, zoos contribute to maintaining ecological equilibrium.

In conclusion, while both arguments present compelling points, the benefits of zoos, in my opinion, outweigh the drawbacks. Nonetheless, it is imperative that zoos elevate their standards to ensure the provision of optimal care and attention to the animals in their custody, thereby mitigating concerns surrounding captivity. ","Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.
On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.
In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention."
Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn?,essay283.txt,"Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.
To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.
Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.
Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.","

Everyone learns differently, making it challenging to evaluate teachers based on student performance. I firmly disagree with the notion of paying teachers according to how much their students learn.

Firstly, teachers' primary responsibility is to impart knowledge within a set timeframe. With a packed curriculum, they must prioritize covering all topics, leaving limited scope to cater to individual students' needs. If teachers focus on specific students, they risk not completing the syllabus on time, potentially depriving other students of essential knowledge.

Secondly, the varying learning abilities among students mean that comprehension rates differ significantly. While some students grasp all topics quickly, others may struggle, leading to disparate test results. This disparity is largely influenced by individual study habits rather than teaching quality. Therefore, it is unfair to tie teacher compensation to student test scores.

Lastly, performance-based pay can compromise educational quality. If teachers' salaries depend on the grades they award, they might prioritize inflating grades over effective teaching methods, undermining the learning process. This potential consequence makes it imperative to exclude student grades from teacher evaluations.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose paying teachers based on student learning outcomes due to the impossibility of personalized attention in a time-constrained classroom setting, the inherent diversity in student learning abilities, and the potential for compromised educational quality.@

Environmental protection vs Economic developments,essay254.txt,"Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. 
First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. 
Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.
Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.
In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?","
Environmental protection and economic development are two pivotal concerns of the 21st century, both crucial for human welfare and future. Given the limited budget and resources, governments must prioritize one over the other. In my opinion, addressing environmental problems takes precedence over economic development for the following compelling reasons.

**Urgency of Environmental Protection**
Environmental degradation poses a more immediate threat than economic instability. The well-being of our planet, Earth, is paramount since it is the sole habitat for all living creatures. Just as a healthy body is essential for human survival, a thriving planet is vital for the collective survival of all species. Without a healthy Earth, even the most impressive economic achievements and infrastructures would ultimately be rendered futile.

**Global Impact of Environmental Issues**
The repercussions of environmental problems far surpass those of economic issues in both scope and profundity. Unlike economic concerns, which can be contained locally, environmental crises are inherently global, affecting every nation indiscriminately. For instance, global warming impacts the entire globe, from the melting of polar ice caps (threatening both Arctic wildlife and low-lying equatorial islands due to rising sea levels) to exacerbating weather conditions worldwide. The interconnectedness of our planet means environmental issues transcend national borders, entwining the fate of all humans.

**Counterargument and Rebuttal**
Some may argue that economic crises, being global and critical, cannot be overlooked, suggesting that severe economic downturns could provoke immediate societal unrest, whereas environmental issues seem more like long-term concerns. However, the reality is that we are currently facing numerous warnings of global climate anomalies and environmental crises. It would be misguided to continue prioritizing economic development, which, ironically, often exacerbates environmental degradation. The urgency of environmental issues can no longer be denied.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, environmental conservation outweighs economic development in terms of both urgency and the breadth of its impact. Just as a person's happiness is deeply rooted in their health, humanity's safety and joy are inextricably linked to the health of our planet. It is paramount that we prioritize environmental protection to ensure a viable future for all. "
Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions,essay057.txt,"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.
Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.
Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.
Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.
However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.","
**Embracing Unfettered Creativity: The Key to Social Progress and Artistic Excellence**

Creativity, the catalyst for innovative thinking, flourishes in the absence of constraints. Despite this, numerous governments impose restrictions on artistic expressions, stifling the potential of creative visionaries. It is imperative that artists are granted the freedom to convey their ideas without hindrance, as unencumbered creativity is the cornerstone of social commentary, aesthetic appeal, and intellectual growth.

**The Power of Creative Expression in Social Commentary**

Throughout history, luminaries like Michelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, and Shakespeare have harnessed the power of art to reflect and critique the societal issues of their epochs. From sculptures to literature, drama to cinema, these works have not only raised awareness about pressing concerns but also inspired introspection among audiences. For instance, the writings of Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin, though controversial, underscore the importance of creative freedom in highlighting social injustices, even in the face of governmental opposition.

**The Dangers of Restriction and the Necessity of Responsiveness**

Restricting artistic expression, as astutely observed by Frank Zappa, is akin to rendering the mind inoperable. Such constraints would undoubtedly stifle innovation and limit the artistic potential of creatives. Like the media, artists should enjoy the liberty to express themselves freely. However, this freedom comes with the responsibility to exercise self-awareness, avoiding works that are gratuitously offensive, hurtful, or devoid of substance, thereby respecting the sentiments of the broader populace.

**Conclusion: Unshackling Creativity for a More Enlightened Society**

In conclusion, the unencumbered expression of creativity is vital for fostering a society that values both artistic excellence and social progress. By embracing freedom of expression, while promoting responsible creativity, we can unlock the full potential of the human mind, unshackled by the fear of restrictive laws or governmental censorship. As we navigate the complexities of our global community, it is this unbridled creativity that will illuminate our path forward. "
We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject,essay398.txt,"

There is a view that universities and colleges should maintain a 1:1 male-to-female student ratio in every faculty. I disagree with this stance, as it overlooks the inherent differences between male and female students.

On one hand, males and females exhibit distinct psychological profiles and individualities. For instance, research suggests that males tend to utilize logical reasoning more frequently, leading to a higher representation in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) globally. Conversely, many females are drawn to humanities, education, and the arts. Additionally, females often excel in emotionally driven and communicative professions, such as teaching, performance arts, and interpretation. This divergence in aptitudes and interests underscores the significant differences between the genders.

Moreover, enforcing equal gender representation in every subject could have detrimental effects on students, as it may disregard their personality traits and hinder their cognitive development. For example, assigning a literature-inclined female student to an engineering department could lead to decreased motivation, ultimately stifling her academic and professional growth.

On the other hand, universities should indeed promote gender diversity within specific subjects, encouraging females to pursue science and males to explore humanities. This approach would mitigate the risks associated with single-gender learning environments, which can negatively impact students' mental well-being.

In conclusion, respecting individual subject choices is crucial, given the inherent diversity between male and female students. Therefore, **we cannot forcibly impose equal male-to-female ratios in every university subject, as it may compromise students' academic and personal development**. ","There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.
On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.
Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.
On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.
In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject."
University education restriction,essay209.txt,"
**University Education: Should Access be Restricted to Top Performers?**

University education is often regarded as the gateway to a successful life, equipping individuals with wisdom and virtue. This raises a pertinent question: should university admissions be reserved for students with exceptional academic records or be open to all aspiring young individuals? To shed light on this debate, let's examine both perspectives before drawing a conclusion.

**The Case for Merit-Based Admissions**
Outstanding academic students possess an intellectual edge, enabling them to grasp complex information with ease. This inherent advantage makes them more suited for university-level studies. Moreover, the principle of deserving one's rewards suggests that those who have worked diligently to achieve academic excellence should be rewarded with university places.

**The Argument for Inclusive Admissions**
However, universities are not solely institutions for academic pursuits; they also foster artistic talents and develop essential soft skills. Therefore, access to university education should be broader, catering to a diverse range of young people eager to nurture their passions and develop holistically.

**The Societal Implications of Restrictive Admissions**
Restricting university access to top performers may exacerbate social issues. The disappointment and disillusionment among those excluded could lead to increased social vices. Furthermore, individuals without the necessary university preparation may struggle in the job market, particularly in white-collar sectors, potentially heightening unemployment rates.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, while restricting university access to top performers has its merits, the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. In my opinion, the potential negative consequences, including increased social vices and diminished job readiness, necessitate that university education be made accessible to a wide range of learners, promoting inclusivity and societal well-being. ","Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.
To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.
However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. 
What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.
In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners."
Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy,essay044.txt,"The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.
Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.
Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.
To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.","
The surging global population and rapid technological advancements have led to an unprecedented demand for energy. Fortunately, abundant and eco-friendly alternatives like nuclear and solar energy can bridge this gap. This essay will delve into the benefits of transitioning to these alternative sources.

Firstly, the over-reliance on hydroelectric power, currently the primary source of energy, is unsustainable. Water scarcity hinders electricity generation, resulting in frequent power outages in developing nations like India during summer months. By incentivizing the adoption of nuclear, solar, or wind energy, governments can ensure a stable and sufficient electricity supply, thereby enhancing energy distribution.

Secondly, the prevalent use of traditional energy sources exacerbates global warming due to substantial greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, alternatives offer a more environmentally friendly approach. For instance, opting for solar cookers over electric ones can significantly mitigate global warming. Similarly, nuclear energy, as a substitute for hydro-kinetic energy, minimizes atmospheric pollution.

In conclusion, promoting alternative energy sources is a prudent strategy for governments. This approach not only leverages available natural resources but also counteracts global warming. To facilitate a seamless transition, governments should implement initiatives that motivate and incentivize the public to adopt solar and nuclear energy, among other alternatives. "
Life in  a city is much better than life in the countryside,essay241.txt,"As far as I am concerned, I firmly agree with the statement that life in a city surpasses life in the countryside in numerous aspects.

**Primarily, Urban Education Excels**: Cities boast superior education systems, characterized by well-equipped classrooms and esteemed professors who prefer to teach in these hubs, offering students unparalleled academic opportunities.

**Enhanced Career Prospects**: Cities provide a broader spectrum of job opportunities, not only in quantity but also in quality, with higher pay scales that offset the increased cost of living, thereby maintaining a better standard of living.

**Cultural Diversity and Enrichment**: The denser population in urban areas fosters immense cultural diversity, allowing for invaluable experiences through interactions with people from varied backgrounds, potentially influencing personal growth and broadening one's outlook.

**Efficient Transportation Networks**: Well-organized and frequent public transportation systems in cities facilitate seamless communication and travel, a stark contrast to the less frequent services found in rural areas.

**Acknowledging Countryside Merits**: While the countryside offers serene, natural environments ideal for relaxation and escaping urban stresses, these benefits are somewhat outweighed by the limitations in opportunities for growth.

**Conclusion**: Considering the plethora of opportunities cities offer for education, career advancement, cultural enrichment, and efficient living, I unequivocally believe that urban life is more advantageous in today's fast-paced world, where rural lifestyles, often tied to agriculture, seem less promising for personal and professional development. Given the choice, I would undoubtedly opt for city living.","As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.
Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.
In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.
Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.
Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.
However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.
Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure."
Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?,essay156.txt,"
It's evident that the depiction of violence in films has increased significantly over the past two decades, often serving as a marketing strategy. From my perspective, I firmly believe that violence in movies has a profoundly negative impact on youngsters, particularly affecting their behavior, emotional well-being, and academic performance.

Firstly, the influence of violent media on children's behavior is a pressing concern for parents. With the rising exposure to TV programs, youngsters often emulate their favorite actors, even when those actors portray violent roles. This unintended imitation can lead to the adoption of aggressive behaviors, thereby altering the child's conduct in a detrimental manner.

Moreover, youngsters are inherently emotionally sensitive. Scenes depicting death or killing can evoke strong, distressing emotions. Exposure to such content on television can inevitably leave a negative emotional imprint on young viewers, potentially leading to long-term psychological effects.

Furthermore, the academic performance of youngsters is also at risk. For instance, watching a frightening movie can preoccupy a child's mind, making it challenging to concentrate on studies, especially during exam periods. This distraction can severely impair a youngster's ability to focus, ultimately affecting their academic achievement.

In conclusion, I unequivocally assert that the growing violence in films has deleterious effects on youngsters, primarily impacting their behavior, emotional stability, and academic success. Therefore, I strongly advocate for stricter parental guidance and regulatory oversight by film directors to mitigate these adverse influences. ","It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.
In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.
Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.
Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.
In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors."
Businesses should be only concerned about making profits.,essay121.txt,"

There is no doubt that the primary objectives of companies, factories, and businesses are to meet consumer needs and generate profits for their stakeholders. Nonetheless, I strongly disagree with the notion that businesses should be solely concerned with making profits, unrestricted by external oversight. Unfettered pursuit of profit can have devastating consequences.

Firstly, unregulated businesses pose a significant threat to the well-being of humans, animals, and the environment. The daily reports of factories releasing toxic substances, harming ecosystems and public health, underscore the need for stringent environmental regulations.

Furthermore, allowing businesses to prioritize profits above all else can lead to the production of low-quality, overpriced products, ultimately jeopardizing consumer safety. A recent, alarming example is the case of a company that sold substandard baby milk, resulting in the tragic loss of infant lives. This highlights the dangers of unchecked profiteering.

In conclusion, it is imperative that governments and regulatory bodies closely monitor all companies, factories, and businesses to prevent the pursuit of profit from coming at the expense of environmental sustainability and human life. Effective oversight is crucial in striking a balance between economic growth and social responsibility. ","There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.
Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.
Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.
In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily."
Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways,essay010.txt,"Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.
First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. 
In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.
In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.","
Nowadays, transportation has become a pressing social concern, sparking debate over whether governments should prioritize investing in traffic infrastructure or developing public transportation. While both sides have merits, a compelling case can be made for allocating more funds to buses, trains, and subways. As these public vehicles cater to a large segment of society, they effectively mitigate traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions, both of which are crucial for a sustainable future.

First and foremost, cutting carbon emissions is vital for preserving the atmosphere. The correlation between the number of cars and motorbikes on the road and the severity of ozone layer damage is well-established. Investing in improved roads may inadvertently encourage more private car usage, leading to increased atmospheric pollution, which can cause skin cancer and devastate the natural environment. Conversely, enhancing public transportation encourages the use of shared vehicles, thereby decreasing emissions. Evidently, prioritizing public transportation has a profoundly positive impact on the environment.

Additionally, this policy would play a pivotal role in alleviating traffic congestion, a pervasive issue in many metropolises. The root cause of this problem lies in the sheer volume of vehicles on the roads. To effectively address this, governments must incentivize the use of public vehicles to reduce the number of private cars and motorbikes. Notably, merely improving roads and highways may not adequately address the underlying causes of congestion.

In conclusion, while high-quality roads and highways undoubtedly facilitate smoother travel, public transportation systems offer more significant benefits, simultaneously easing traffic congestion and protecting the atmosphere. This dual advantage is a key reason why many governments worldwide are channeling more resources into developing robust public transportation networks. "
People should have hobbies and do physical activities,essay215.txt,"The debate about the importance of having hobbies and engaging in physical activities has sparked diverse opinions. While some argue that focusing solely on work is paramount, I firmly disagree. In my view, pursuing personal hobbies and physical activities yields numerous benefits that enhance our overall well-being.

**Physiological Benefits**
Engaging in hobbies and physical activities is paramount for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Prolonged screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and vision problems. A compelling example is my neighbor, Tom, a former computer engineer who transformed his life by incorporating jogging into his daily routine. Within a month, his weight loss not only improved his physical health but also boosted his personal life, as evidenced by his newfound relationship.

**Mental Refreshment**
Monotony can be overwhelming; hobbies and sports provide a vital mental reprieve. Just as schools intersperse classes with breaks to rejuvenate students, adults also need intervals to reboot. Unlike machines, humans cannot operate incessantly without rest. Brief interludes of hobby-related or sporting activities can significantly recharge our mental batteries.

**Emotional Expression and Relief**
Cultivating a personal hobby serves as a healthy outlet for emotional expression, particularly during periods of distress or pressure. For instance, playing a musical instrument, such as the classical guitar, which I personally enjoy, offers solace. Whenever academic challenges overwhelm me, playing ""Green Sleeves"" on my guitar uplifts my mood and instills confidence.

**Conclusion**
Although developing hobbies and engaging in physical activities requires a considerable investment of time, the rewards are multifaceted: a healthier body, a refreshed mind, and a constructive means of emotional release. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the pursuit of hobbies and physical activities that complement our professional lives, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling existence.","Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.
First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.
Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.
Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.
Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work."
Classroom learnng vs online education,essay297.txt,"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.
First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.
Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.
Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.
It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. 
From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.","
There exists a longstanding debate about whether distance learning and online computer classes should supplant traditional classroom learning. In my opinion, online classes should not replace classroom learning. Here are the key reasons underpinning my stance.

Firstly, classroom learning offers a uniquely effective educational environment. Observing peers who excel academically can foster a competitive spirit, driving personal improvement. A personal anecdote illustrates this: during my first year of B Com, witnessing friends outperform me motivated me to enhance my academic standing, ultimately leading to securing the top rank in the final examination.

Secondly, traditional classroom settings promote timely completion of coursework, honing essential time management skills. Additionally, group study participation enhances communication and teamwork abilities, vital for future career success. The structured environment of a classroom encourages discipline and punctuality, traits that are invaluable in professional contexts.

Thirdly, the guidance of professors, who are often subject matter experts, is invaluable in classroom learning. Their personalized feedback, face-to-face interaction, and clarifying responses to queries facilitate quicker comprehension. My personal experience with TOEFL IBT preparation underscores this point: after a month of relying on online courses yielded limited progress, joining an institute led to a significant improvement in my English skills within the same timeframe.

While acknowledging the supplementary benefits of online classes, it's clear they cannot fully replace the richness of traditional classroom learning. 

In conclusion, based on the aforementioned points, it is evident that classroom learning remains the most effective method of education, offering a holistic development experience that online platforms currently cannot replicate. "
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues,essay171.txt,"In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.
In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.","

In today's world, where the welfare state is paramount, governments must prioritize sustainable healthcare and health education for their citizens. I strongly advocate for allocating a greater proportion of health budgets to health education and preventative measures.

**Primary Rationale: Enhanced Healthcare Efficacy**
Allocating more funds to education and prevention can significantly improve the overall healthcare system. By reducing the patient influx, hospitals and healthcare centers can manage resources more effectively, leading to enhanced treatment outcomes for those in need. Empowering society through health awareness enables proactive measures against illnesses, thereby decreasing the burden on treatment services.

**Secondary Rationale: Societal Well-being**
The welfare of society hinges on the health of its citizens. Given that health is the cornerstone of human happiness, governments have a crucial role in providing resources that educate citizens on illness prevention, mitigating misery and promoting overall well-being. A compelling example is the Turkish Ministry of Health's anti-smoking campaign targeting youth, which notably improved the lifestyle and well-being of those who quit smoking post-campaign.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, prioritizing education and prevention in health budgets over treatment is pivotal for achieving a more efficient healthcare system and a heightened level of societal well-being, ultimately fulfilling the core principles of a welfare state. "
Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?,essay284.txt,"When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.
First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.
Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.
In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.
Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.","

When watching movies or dramas, some viewers prefer to see good characters rewarded and bad ones punished, while others disagree. Personally, I lean towards seeing good characters thrive, but with a nuanced approach. Here’s why:

Firstly, predictable outcomes can lead to monotony. If every story concludes with good triumphing over evil, the plot becomes foreseeable, diminishing viewer interest. In contrast, unpredictable endings keep audiences engaged, eager to discover the story's conclusion. For instance, the repetitive happy endings in Hollywood films, such as the quintessential hero-victorious narrative, have grown tiresome for many, including myself. This oversaturation underscores the need for varied storytelling in movies and TV shows.

Moreover, real life often diverges from the typical good-triumphs-over-evil narrative. Good individuals can, and sometimes do, face adverse outcomes. If children are consistently exposed to simplistic, reward-based storylines, they may develop unrealistic expectations about the world. This could lead to disappointment and disillusionment when confronted with the complexity of reality. It's essential to convey to young audiences that goodness is not solely driven by the promise of reward, but by the inherent value of doing good, regardless of outcome.

While it's true that inspirational storylines can motivate people to act virtuously, this effect is often short-lived, as the harsh realities of life eventually set in. Therefore, I propose that stories should strive to reflect the complexity of real life, presenting varied outcomes that encourage viewers to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to be good, beyond the promise of reward.

In conclusion, movies and TV programs should feature diverse narratives where good characters may receive rewards, face challenges, or experience outcomes that lie somewhere in between, mirroring the intricacies of the real world. "
The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life?,essay372.txt,"There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.
It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.
In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.
To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.","
There is no doubt that the integration of technological advancements in some countries will be accompanied by modern skills and new lifestyles. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the preservation of traditional skills and ways of life is crucial, despite concerns that cultural exchange might lead to their disappearance. Instead, I argue that their role will evolve, not vanish.

Undoubtedly, a nation's cultural heritage is primarily conveyed through traditional skills and customs. For example, in Vietnam, the decline of water puppet shows – once a showcase of seasonal agriculture and communal activities – in favor of cinemas and concerts, limits the younger generation's experiential understanding of their ancestors' lives. They must now rely on books and images, a less immersive means of connection.

Embracing tradition allows individuals to reflect on the past, often through customary handicrafts or antique lifestyles, to inform progress. Gleaning insights into our predecessors' struggles and triumphs yields invaluable lessons for contemporary society. Moreover, learning from their mistakes enables us to navigate our own challenges more effectively.

In conclusion, traditional skills and ways of life are irreplaceable. They are the cornerstone of self-awareness and experiential knowledge, making their preservation throughout history a worthy endeavor deserving of our collective attention. "
"Under suitable administration, tourism enhances local economic development",essay130.txt,"Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.
The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.
Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.
After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.","
Tourism has emerged as a pivotal driver of economic growth, sparking debate about its ecological and societal implications. While some argue that tourism's drawbacks overshadow its benefits, I firmly believe that, with effective management and regulation, a thriving tourism industry can be a cornerstone of economic development for rural and urban areas.

The primary advantage of tourism lies in its profound impact on local economic growth, fueled by direct tourist expenditure, as well as the creation of direct and indirect job opportunities across various sectors, including retail, agriculture, and services. Well-regulated tourism programs also yield significant tax revenues and stimulate the expansion of local markets for accommodations, luxury goods, and more. Notably, the proliferation of job opportunities empowers individuals to contribute meaningfully to society through increased consumer spending, thereby energizing the economic cycle and fostering local prosperity.

Critics often cite environmental degradation and cultural erosion as counterarguments. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that alternative industries, such as resource extraction and manufacturing, have far more devastating environmental consequences. For instance, paper mills generate massive water pollution, outpacing the ecological footprint of tourism. Moreover, the majority of tourists, particularly those investing substantial time and resources in exploring rural villages, are educated and likely to behave responsibly when guided by regulations.

Upon weighing both perspectives, it becomes clear that the tourism sector's socioeconomic benefits are unparalleled. In conclusion, under prudent administration, the advantages of tourism unequivocally outweigh its disadvantages, rendering it an indispensable component of local economic development. "
Children can effectively learn from watching television,essay361.txt,"

TV, as a vast source of information, can indeed facilitate learning and skill development in students. However, I argue that unregulated TV viewing at both school and home can hinder overall growth. Excessive screen time can have detrimental effects on health and academic performance.

Undoubtedly, TV is a primary source of global and local updates, with channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, and Etv Marathi providing invaluable insights. Watching TV can also enhance extracurricular skills. For instance, cooking shows teach culinary arts, while sports events like cricket and football impart leadership, teamwork, communication, and other essential skills beneficial for future careers.

Conversely, prolonged TV viewing can severely impact children's health, leading to premature eyesight problems and back pain. Exposure to age-inappropriate content can have profound psychological consequences. Moreover, addiction to favorite programs, such as cartoons or sports, can distract students from their studies, particularly during exam periods, resulting in poor grades.

In conclusion, while TV offers some benefits, its drawbacks outweigh its advantages. Unrestricted TV viewing, lacking proper parental or educational oversight, would likely yield more negative consequences for children's development, emphasizing the need for balanced and supervised TV engagement.","TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.
It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.
But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. 
In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children."
Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals,essay304.txt,"In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.
First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.
In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.
In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.","
In the face of the world's population surpassing seven billion for the first time in history, the destruction of natural environments to accommodate human needs has reached a critical point. The question arises: should we prioritize preserving land for endangered species or allocate it for human necessities? In my opinion, a shift in our environmental attitude is imperative for several compelling reasons.

Firstly, maintaining biodiversity is crucial for future generations. If we fail to alter our course, we risk driving to extinction species that have thrived for millions of years. The destruction of natural habitats, such as forests, jungles, and lakes, for industrial and agricultural purposes, severely disrupts the ecosystem. For instance, the alarming rate of deforestation in South America's Rainforest, primarily for timber and farmland, threatens the very survival of numerous endangered animals, depriving future generations of the opportunity to coexist with and study these species.

Moreover, a stable and sustainable environment is vital for regulating global weather patterns. Human activities leading to pollution have a devastating impact on Earth's climate, exacerbating the undeniable phenomenon of Global Warming. This not only imperils endangered animals but also poses significant threats to human populations, as evidenced by rising sea levels and climatic shifts. According to recent United Nations Organization studies, the global sea level is projected to rise by over one meter by 2050, which will profoundly affect coastal communities and reshape the global climate.

In conclusion, as underscored by the aforementioned arguments, it is unequivocal that we must revolutionize our approach to the environment. This transformation is not only essential for preserving endangered species but also for safeguarding our own living conditions, thereby ensuring a sustainable coexistence between human needs and environmental preservation. "
Sense of cooperation,essay342.txt,"In today's educational system, numerous competitions in academic and athletic areas stimulate children's desire to learn and excel, while also teaching teamwork skills. However, a debate arises between fostering competitiveness versus cooperation in children, with each approach having its merits.

**The Case for Competition:**
A strong competitive spirit, often encouraged by schools and parents through grading systems, motivates children to strive for excellence, driving them to pursue goals and overcome obstacles independently. Although this mindset can lead to success, it also risks making children overly competitive, hindering their ability to collaborate effectively in team projects. For instance, highly competitive individuals may struggle with teamwork, limiting their potential in group settings.

**The Importance of Cooperation:**
Conversely, cooperation is a vital quality for children to develop, both in school and community activities. A strong cooperative spirit enables kids to communicate effectively, build relationships, and solve problems collaboratively, ultimately achieving goals more efficiently as a team. Notably, even highly successful individuals, such as renowned singers or movie stars, owe their accomplishments partly to the support of their management teams.

**Conclusion:**
In my opinion, while a competitive nature may provide initial motivation and a drive for success, it may not serve children as well in the long run, particularly in societal and professional contexts where teamwork is paramount. Therefore, I firmly believe that schools and adults should prioritize instilling a sense of cooperation in children, empowering them to become valuable contributors to both society and their communities. ","In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.
A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.
On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.
In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community."
