health_insurance_cover_complementary_medicine (en),micro_b003,"Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven. Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases. Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments. But as long as it is unclear as to how this works, the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty.","Health insurance companies should not cover complementary medicine treatments unless robust, empirical evidence substantiates their claimed effects and medical benefits. Since such proof is predominantly absent, prioritizing evidence-based therapies is prudent. Although patients often report symptom alleviation post-treatment, the unknown mechanisms underlying these outcomes necessitate allocating funds to therapies with established efficacy, ensuring optimal resource utilization and patient outcomes."
cap_rent_increases (en),micro_b009,It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents. Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease. But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease. All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease.,"It is unfair and unjustifiable to impose significantly higher rents on new tenants compared to previous residents. While landlords understandably incur costs for pre-lease repairs, these expenses could be more equitably distributed through a modest, incremental rent increase over the lease's duration. Moreover, to maintain an adequate profit margin, there's no inherent necessity to raise the rental rate with every new lease, suggesting that more gradual adjustments would be a fairer approach."
allow_shops_to_open_on_holidays_and_sundays (en),micro_b060,"Allowing shops to open on holidays and Sundays could be a double-edged sword for retailers. While owner-run shops might face increased operational burdens, the dominant market presence of supermarkets and large shopping centers could mitigate this concern. Conversely, smaller shops might thrive with the added flexibility, as they could cater to more relaxed Sunday customers, potentially leading to mutual benefits for both local businesses and consumers, who would enjoy enhanced convenience and a more leisurely shopping experience on these days. ","Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays, then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already. Thus smaller shops could benefit from the additional freedom, as customers are on average more laid-back on Sunday. Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops."
introduce_capital_punishment (en),micro_k009,"Germany should by no means introduce capital punishment. If there were capital punishment, this would mean people are allowed to put themselves above others and rule over their lives. Capital punishment would be murder and would have to be punished with the death penalty itself. What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on although they have taken or destroyed another life? Yes, for it is a much graver punishment to be imprisoned forever and be tortured by one's own thoughts than to be killed quickly and easily by an injection.","Germany should refrain from introducing capital punishment. Here's why: 

* **Erosion of Moral High Ground**: Implementing capital punishment would imply that individuals are granted the right to decide over others' lives, undermining the principle of equality before the law.
* **Paradox of Punishment**: Capital punishment, in essence, is state-sanctioned murder. This creates a philosophical conundrum where the punishment for murder would, paradoxically, be more murder, necessitating a death penalty for the state itself.
* **Addressing Heinous Crimes**: For criminals convicted of severe offenses like murder or rape, the question arises whether they should be spared despite their deeds. 
* **Alternative to Capital Punishment**: A more profound form of punishment exists - lifelong imprisonment. This not only removes the criminal from society but also subjects them to a prolonged period of introspection and psychological torment, arguably a more severe penalty than the swift, relatively painless death offered by lethal injection. This approach upholds justice while maintaining the moral integrity of the state."
keep_retirement_at_63 (en),micro_b022,"No, the retirement age should be raised to 65 again. People are getting older on average, but they are not sicker and not duller because of it. Without them we'd forgo a great deal of collected experience. And we'd have to offer more leisure activities for seniors.","No, the retirement age should indeed be raised to 65. Given the upward trend in average life expectancy, people are not only living longer but also generally maintaining their health and cognitive abilities well into their 60s. Retaining them in the workforce would preserve a vast repository of accumulated experience, thereby enriching our professional and societal fabric. Conversely, an earlier retirement would necessitate a significant investment in additional leisure activities and support structures for seniors, potentially straining resources."
increase_weight_of_BA_thesis_in_final_grade (en),micro_k023,"The BA dissertation should, if not make up the entire grade, then at least constitute a larger share of it. For a good overall grade opens many doors, but is not of top priority for employers. With a BA dissertation one can, however, demonstrate interests and subject matter expertise particularly well. After all one doesn't excel in every subject.","The BA dissertation should constitute a significantly larger share of the final grade, as its value extends beyond mere academic achievement. While a strong overall grade can open various opportunities, it often doesn't convey specific expertise to employers. In contrast, a BA dissertation provides a unique platform to showcase specialized interests and in-depth subject matter expertise, highlighting a student's exceptional strengths in a particular area, which may not always be reflected in their overall grade due to variations in performance across subjects."
EU_influence_on_political_events_in_Ukraine (en),micro_b056,"A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction! Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long, and when it has finally reacted, the only remaining option has usually been war. It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate, as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure. Since, however, in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule, the EU should intervene right away.","
A violation of international law warrants a swift response, lest we repeat history's mistakes of delayed intervention, often culminating in devastating conflict. In a democratic society, the populace should ideally self-determine their fate, free from the sway of propaganda, corruption, and military coercion. Given Russia's heavily influential propaganda and corruption, alongside its dominant gas and oil industries, the EU has a compelling rationale to intervene promptly, upholding democratic principles and international law, while preventing potential escalation.

allow_shops_to_open_on_holidays_and_sundays (en),micro_k013,"Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work. Likewise public holidays should remain what they are: for some a day of introspection, for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper. Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays. People, however, who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem: everyone else can shop weekdays, but they can't. For those people the late opening hours, which meanwhile already extend to 12:00 midnight, present a good alternative.","Allowing shops to open on holidays and Sundays raises concerns about work-life balance and the sanctity of these days. 

On one hand, supermarket employees and shopping centre staff deserve a Sunday off, aligning with the traditional purpose of public holidays as days for introspection or a paid break, not deducted from annual leave. Restricting Sunday and holiday trading hours respects this.

On the other hand, individuals working weekdays and Saturdays face inconvenience, as they cannot shop during their limited free time. In contrast, late evening shopping (often until 12:00 midnight) on other days provides a viable alternative for this demographic, striking a balance between respecting traditional holiday closures and accommodating diverse schedules."
charge_tuition_fees (en),micro_b021,"Tuition fees should be abolished in Germany, as access to higher education is a fundamental right that should be universally accessible. Imposing tuition fees can have a counterproductive effect, leading to prolonged study durations as students often need to balance academic pursuits with part-time jobs, ultimately increasing overall educational costs for individuals and potentially hindering their academic success.",Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany. Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone. Fees result in longer durations of studies. That's costly!
public_broadcasting_fees_on_demand (en),micro_k027,"The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters. After all there are many people in Germany who pay the fee although they merely use a computer to work. Yet the fees are demanded from everybody who does not apply for a waiver, no matter how many receiver devices actually exist in the household and how they are being used. However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device.","The TV license fee should be reformed to a usage-based model, where only individuals who actively consume public broadcasting content are required to pay. Currently, in Germany, the fee is levied on all households with a device, regardless of actual usage, even if the device is solely used for work or non-broadcasting purposes (e.g., computers). Since verifying individual device usage is impractical for licensing authorities, a more equitable approach would be to only charge those who benefit from public broadcasting services, thereby aligning costs with consumption.
