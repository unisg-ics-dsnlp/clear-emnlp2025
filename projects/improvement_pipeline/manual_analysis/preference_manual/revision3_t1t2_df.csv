Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_8.txt,"The growth of technology and its implementation has been at its panache in the 21st century. Automation and artificial intelligence are the new buzzwords and implementation effort has been reduced drastically due to availability of high computing resources. Automobile industry too has been part of this automation wave and self driving cars is an example of the same. Driving in itself has been a passion for some, mundane task for others and extremely difficult for few. Recent improvements in road infrastructure has reduced the overall effort required in driving and self-driving cars can further eliminate this. Reduction in overall effort, more automation and safety can directly translate into more productivity and efficiency. Though we can see huge advantages of such automation, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles as we still need to address some important concerns and achieve perfection before we all are on the same page.
	Better global economy, more international trade and cheap manufacturing labor lead to a boom in automobile industry. Developing countries where car was still considered a luxury 20 years ago is now an easy commodity to own. However, being born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, and it was always a challenge to drive in remote areas with uneven terrain and bad weather conditions. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the superpower known for its infrastructure and safety vehicles which are also linked as a symbol of personal freedom. One major concern is that developed countries like the United States cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars and we should consider tougher conditions even if we would only like to implement these vehicles in cities with good infrastructure. Success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such satellite service is still prone to errors and not available every at every remote location. GPS are also not very reliable to extreme weather conditions and can be a major hurdle in providing accuracy to self-driving cars. Mathematics and algorithms which are the backbone of this automation can still not achieve 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios. 
	Self-driving cars still need humans behind the wheel who are capable to operate sophisticated technology. Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology and specially true for many people in their middle and old age. Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction that can put the driver into more dangerous and complex situation than before. Even if we do achieve the scientific perfection, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is still tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. Overall cost involved in implementation, building perfect road infrastructure and training individuals surpass the expected utility of the complete program. 
	Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can be the reason for a major accident and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator behind the wheel (less of a driver) to understand this and can be unavoidable due to lack of manual control. Tough terrains, like mountains, where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of such malfunction. 
	The research idea behind implementation of self-driving cars is amazing, but is still at nascent stage and requires more research and development before it can be actually implemented as a real world solution. Multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs are still linked with the idea of implementation and we need to address each constraint individually. Overall it  is much easier to successfully implement such technology in developed nations and in constrained environment but not yet feasible all around the globe.","
The 21st century has witnessed unprecedented growth in technology, with automation and artificial intelligence transforming various sectors, including the automobile industry through self-driving cars. While driving is a passion for some, a mundane task for others, and a challenge for a few, recent infrastructure improvements have reduced driving efforts, which self-driving cars could further eliminate. This could lead to increased productivity and efficiency. However, despite these advantages, I strongly believe that the implementation of self-driving vehicles requires addressing crucial concerns and achieving perfection before global adoption.

The global economy's growth, international trade, and affordable manufacturing have led to an automobile boom, making cars more accessible, especially in developing countries. However, regions with challenging infrastructure, like the Himalayan foothills where I grew up, pose significant driving challenges due to treacherous terrain and inclement weather. While self-driving cars have excelled in the U.S., a country renowned for its infrastructure and safety standards, it's imperative to test them under tougher conditions, even if initial implementation is planned for cities with good infrastructure.

Several concerns hinder the widespread adoption of self-driving cars:
1. **Reliance on Accurate Mapping Systems:** Success depends on precise GPS mapping, which is prone to errors and unavailable in all remote locations, particularly under extreme weather conditions.
2. **Algorithmic Limitations:** Despite advancements, mathematics and algorithms cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, potentially leading to critical failures in unforeseen scenarios.
3. **Human Reluctance and Operational Complexity:** Many, especially the middle-aged and elderly, are hesitant to relinquish control to technology, which could lead to malfunctions, placing drivers in more perilous situations.
4. **Financial Feasibility:** The overall cost of large-scale implementation, coupled with the need for perfect road infrastructure and user training, surpasses the expected utility, rendering it financially unviable.
5. **Safety Concerns:** Recent incidents involving self-driving cars in accidents raise skepticism about their ability to completely eliminate accidents. Malfunctions, particularly in challenging terrains, can be catastrophic due to the lack of manual control.

In conclusion, while the concept of self-driving cars is innovative, its implementation is still in its infancy, necessitating further research and development to overcome constraints such as infrastructure, GPS reliability, weather conditions, financial viability, and safety concerns. Successful implementation may be more feasible in developed nations with controlled environments, but it remains a significant challenge for global adoption."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_80.txt,"

Far too often, the media highlights devastating stories of innocent people killed in car accidents caused by drunk or distracted drivers. A proposed, yet contentious, solution is introducing self-driving cars on our roads. While numerous benefits exist, I remain opposed to their widespread adoption in society. 

The advantages of self-driving cars are clear: they significantly reduce human error, responsible for 81% of car accidents. This would lead to a decrease in minor accidents, such as rear-endings, as self-driving cars utilize algorithms to calculate optimal stopping distances. Additionally, as noted by Google's self-driving car program director, these vehicles are more courteous and defensive drivers than their human counterparts, fostering safer driving conditions for all. 

Furthermore, self-driving cars would greatly benefit elderly and disabled individuals, enabling them to travel independently, as highlighted by The New York Times. The stress of parking would also diminish, as self-driving cars drop passengers off at their destination, resulting in fewer parking tickets and saved time. Moreover, ""platooning"" – electronic communication between self-driving cars – would reduce traffic congestion, allowing more vehicles on the road and potentially leading to higher speed limits and optimized gasoline usage. Overall, self-driving cars promise improved travel experiences with enhanced safety, reduced traffic, and time savings.

However, significant drawbacks temper these benefits. The current hefty price tag of over $100,000 restricts accessibility for many Americans, and even as taxis, the high costs would deter potential customers. Limited adoption would also undermine the potential accident prevention, time, and cost savings, as ""platooning"" would be ineffective without widespread use. This raises the question: what's the incentive for adopting self-driving cars if their key features are underutilized?

Moreover, reliance on sensors, GPS devices, and traffic signals creates vulnerabilities, as technical failures or inclement weather could impair functionality, putting passengers and other road users at risk. The anxiety and danger posed by potential malfunctions are considerable. On a broader scale, the ethical implications of accidents involving human-driven and self-driving cars are ambiguous, necessitating the establishment of new laws to address blame and liability.

In conclusion, while self-driving cars offer efficient solutions to various driving issues, their incorporation into modern society poses too significant a threat, primarily due to the high cost and associated hesitations. The gradual transition would create sustained road tension. As the benefits do not currently outweigh the persistent drawbacks, it may be premature for America to adopt self-driving cars. ","Far too often, the media presents heart-wrenching stories of innocent people killed in car accidents from drunk or distracted drivers. Who would argue against a solution to these preventable problems? One proposed yet controversial solution is implementing self-driving cars on the roads. While many benefits exist, I still do not support their use in society. The benefits of self-driving cars are easily understood: they greatly reduce human error, which causes 81% of car accidents. The number of minor accidents like rear-endings would decrease because the computers of self-driving cars would use algorithms to calculate appropriate stopping distances. On the same note, as Google's director of their self-driving car program stated, self-driving cars are more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers. Better, more cautious drivers would lead to safer driving conditions for all parties. Furthermore, as The New York Times suggests, self-driving cars would greatly help elderly and disabled people travel. Self-driving cars would be of great use to those who cannot operate a vehicle. Plus, the stress of parking would decrease as self-driving cars drop passengers off at their destination. People would receive less parking tickets and save time on parking, making an overall easier travel experience. Additionally, self-driving cars would also reduce traffic congestion by electronically communicating in a process called “platooning” and enable more people to be on the road at once. The roads would greatly improve with steadier traffic and quicker travel times, with potentially higher speed limits. Other drivers could even maximize their gasoline usage. Overall, self-driving cars would offer people better travel with safer roads, less traffic, and time saved. However, self-driving cars pose many drawbacks. To begin, self-driving cars currently have a huge price tag of over $100,000, thereby diminishing the number of Americans able to buy one. Even if people do not purchase self-driving cars, the high cost to use them as a taxi would deter potential customers. Also, if self-driving cars do not become extremely widespread, they would not offer their maximum potential in preventing accidents and saving time and cost because they could not platoon together. Why would America use self-driving cars at all if these features would go to waste? Moreover, self-driving cars that rely on sensors, GPS devices, and traffic signals would malfunction if these other technology sources failed. Specifically, inclement weather impairs the sensor abilities of self-driving cars, putting people on the road during a storm at risk. Both passengers in self-driving cars and people driving next to them would feel anxious at the idea of the cars malfunctioning. With many places for technical errors, self-driving cars could be quite dangerous and daunting for all travelers. On a broader scale, ethical concerns would arise during a car accident with a human and self-driving car, leaving ambiguous blame toward the car itself and the car company. We must consider the potential legal implications and establish new ethical laws before we use self-driving cars. In short, America would not fully gain all of the benefits of self-driving cars unless more were on the road than human drivers, but this concept would not happen quickly due to high cost and people's hesitations. The transition phase of slowly adding self-driving cars would cause lingering tension on the road. While self-driving cars offer an efficient solution to multiple driving issues, they pose too big of a threat to incorporate into modern society.  At this time, since the perks do not outweigh the persistent cons, perhaps America is not ready for self-driving cars."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_83.txt,"As with most modern automation technologies, self-driving cars present a balance of costs and benefits. Evidence suggests they would significantly enhance road safety, reduce costs, and mitigate the devastating impact of traffic accidents - a leading cause of death in modern society. While unforeseen disadvantages may arise, the overall benefits to society are likely to outweigh these concerns.

Acknowledging that self-driving cars are not immune to accidents is crucial; potential risks include malfunctions, adverse weather conditions, and limitations in interpreting human traffic signals. However, these risks pale in comparison to the current dangers posed by human error, which, as noted, accounts for 81% of car accidents. By minimizing human error, self-driving cars could drastically decrease fatalities and injuries, thereby healing the wounds of countless families, schools, and communities.

The cost-effectiveness of self-driving cars extends far beyond insurance and healthcare savings. These vehicles can coordinate to prevent and alleviate traffic congestion, leading to lower fuel expenses. Additionally, reallocating police resources, previously dedicated to road patrols, could enhance public safety. With the burden of driving lifted, individuals can utilize their time more productively during commutes, engaging in activities like reading, working, or communicating, potentially enabling longer, more convenient commutes.

Self-driving cars would revolutionize transportation accessibility for all. The elderly, disabled individuals, and those in areas with limited public transportation options would greatly benefit. Moreover, self-driving cars would inherently solve the issue of driving under the influence, acting as designated drivers for those intoxicated.

Although concerns about job losses in the transportation sector are valid, this transition would likely be gradual, accompanied by new employment or training opportunities, particularly considering that many in this sector work part-time. It's essential to weigh these concerns against the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives annually, drawing parallels with the necessity of transitioning to renewable energy sources to combat climate change. Historically, the pursuit of improving human lives has driven us forward, despite initial fears, and self-driving cars should be no exception.","As with most modern technologies associated with automation, there are both costs and benefits to self-driving cars. Evidence suggests they would create a safer, more cost-effective driving experience and would eliminate many of the tragic accidents that contribute to one of the leading causes of death in modern society. While there may be certain disadvantages to this technology, some which we cannot yet predict, I believe self-driving cars would be overall beneficial to society. 
	It would be naive to think that self-driving cars wouldn't cause any car accidents. There would still be risks of malfunction due to glitches, bad weather, or not being able to take into account human traffic signals, but these considerations come nowhere near the amount of risk drivers currently face on the road. In fact, according to the article, 81 percent of car accidents are attributable to human error. Taking human error out of the equation would dramatically reduce the amount of deaths and injuries that result from car crashes and that have shattered families, schools and entire communities for decades. 
	The cost-effectiveness of self-driving cars goes beyond just how much money would be saved from insurance and healthcare costs. Self-driving cars will have the ability to coordinate with each other to prevent and reduce traffic, which means gas expenses would be lower. By reducing the need for police officers to be patrolling the roads, their resources could be allocated elsewhere. And, finally, without having to focus the majority of their attention on driving, drivers would be able to save time and do other important things on the road such as reading, working or talking on the phone. In fact, self-driving cars may allow people to commute longer distances to work.
	Self-driving cars would make transportation more accessible for everyone. Disabled individuals, the elderly, as well as people in communities with little access to other forms of public transportation would benefit from these cars. Further, self-driving cars would act as designated drivers for people who are intoxicated, eliminating the issue of driving under the influence completely. 
	Though there is concern that self-driving cars could put people who work in the transportation sector out of work, this would be a gradual process that would go hand in hand with new employment or training opportunities for those employees, many of whom only work in this sector part-time to begin with. Further, this kind of argument is also used in matters of climate change by people who believe that the jobs of those currently in the coal and natural gas industries are more important than the dire need to switch to renewable energy sources in order to curb climate change. We have to ask ourselves whether the employment of people in the transportation sector and the fallout they would experience in a world with self-driving cars is more important than the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives a year. 
	As a country, we have seldom let our fears stop us from striving to improve human lives, and I am confident that we will do the same with self-driving cars."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_23.txt,"
As technology advances rapidly, innovators are exploring self-driving cars, transforming a once-futuristic concept into a potential reality. While this innovation may evoke images of a Utopian society, its societal impact is multifaceted. Proponents often associate self-driving cars with unparalleled leisure, reduced stress, and fewer accidents due to the elimination of human error. However, this perspective overlooks the potential for human error in programming, algorithm miscalculations, and technological faults, which could mirror the risks associated with human drivers.

The implementation of self-driving cars poses significant challenges that currently outweigh their benefits. A primary argument in their favor is the absence of distractions, but this overlooks the irreplicable human reactions and instincts. The misconception that self-driving cars can surpass human decision-making capabilities is misguided, as machines cannot fully replicate primal human judgment. 

Consider a scenario where a self-driving car encounters a sudden obstacle, such as a shopping cart, with a pedestrian nearby. While algorithms might suggest swerving, a human could instinctively decide to prioritize the pedestrian's safety. This highlights the gap in judgment and instinct between humans and machines.

Real-world incidents, like the recent case of a self-driving car striking a pedestrian at night due to undetected emergence from a dark spot, underscore the vehicles' current developmental shortcomings. Moreover, in the era of cyber warfare, the susceptibility of self-driving car technology to hacking poses a formidable threat, with potentially disastrous consequences.

The costs of implementing self-driving cars are prohibitively high, with estimated development costs around $100,000 per vehicle. This investment could be better allocated to pressing societal needs or medical research, which currently faces underfunding. For instance, redirecting these funds towards combating life-threatening diseases could potentially save millions of lives.

In conclusion, while self-driving cars may offer some benefits, they lack the nuanced decision-making and instinctual capabilities of humans. Coupled with their luxury status, lack of societal necessity, and the significant risks involved, it is prudent to reconsider the widespread implementation of self-driving cars into society, as their potential drawbacks substantially outweigh their advantages. ","As technology continues to progress at a rapid pace innovators have begun to explore the possibility of self-driving cars. A society with self-driving cars sounds like a child's response to the question ""What does the future look like"". Self-driving cars evoke fantastical thoughts of what a futuristic Utopian society looks like. However, self-driving cars are no longer a fantasy idea, and the impact that these vehicles may have on society is immense. To many in society, the term ""self-driving cars"" is synonymous with complete leisure . With a self-driving car there is no need to be stressed driving or road rage because something else is in charge of the wheel. There are notions that self-driving cars could help to limit accidents due to the fact that they take away the human error of driving. While somewhat naive, it is generally thought that these cars will be programmed to easily avoid accidents and obey all traffic laws. However, this is a very idealistic way of examining the situation. Self-driving cars still hold their fair share of negative consequences for society. While, on the surface, it may appear as though self-driving cars are eliminating the human error in driving they are simply replacing it with another opportunity for human error. There is still a strong possibility of human error in the actual programming of the vehicles. The algorithms could be miscalculated or the technology of the vehicle could be faulty, resulting in a similar high-risk potential to an average human driver. This, along with several other reasons, is why society would not benefit from the  continued push for the implementation of self-driving cars. 
	The risks of self-driving cars are currently too difficult to overcome when it comes to implementing them into society. One argument for self-driving cars is that they will not be distracted like human drivers can be since they will have an specific set of algorithms to follow while on the road. While it is true that human drivers face hundreds of distractions while driving they still have certain human reactions and instincts that cannot be replicated by a machine. One of the gravest misconceptions associated with these vehicles is that the decision-making aspects of a self-driving car is greater than that of an average human. However, this theory is ill-advised as a machine cannot recreate the enhanced and primal judgment of a human being. While those who produce these self-driving cars will attempt to ensure that their decision-making is on equal to a human being's, there is simply no way to completely and accurately replicate human instincts. Imagine, a scenario in which a self-driving car is cruising steadily down the road past a grocery store when suddenly a shopping cart comes directly into its path and it does not have enough time to stop. Algorithms would suggest that the car  swerve to avoid the shopping cart. But now imagine that there is a human being crossing the street parallel to the shopping cart. How will the self-driving car know that it would be better to brace the impact of the cart and hit that directly instead of the human. It is not clear that a self-driving car would posses the judgment and instincts to process that decision in a matter of milliseconds. On the other hand, a human would at least be capable of knowing making the conscious decision to avoid the human being. 
        A real-life example of how these self-driving cars may be unable to pick up on various signals outside of the vehicle is the incident that recently happened in the United States. A few months ago there was a self-driving car that struck a pedestrian at night. It was reported that the car did not recognize the pedestrian because they appeared out of a dark spot that the car's cameras did not pick up on. This lack of ability to pick up on stimuli and night show that these cars are not yet developed enough to be ushered into society. 
	In the age of cyber warfare it is also obvious that these self-driving cars pose a threat to possible hackers. The technology that is used in self-driving cars is susceptible to outside hackers who could interfere with the self-driving algorithms thus causing extremely dangerous conditions for drivers. Yes, there can be measures put in place to try and combat these hackers; however, there is no steadfast way to ensure the safety and security of this type of technology. It is terrifying to imagine the consequences that would result from self-driving cars being overrun by hackers and used in a form of cyber warfare. Motor vehicles are already viewed as possible weapons even when they are being controlled by innocent and responsible humans, but if these vehicles can easily be taken advantage of by outside hackers, who seek to cause harm, the risk would appear to be too great for society. 
	The costs of implementing self-driving cars into society would be extremely high and would not pose any direct benefits to society than what we already have. The amount of money that would go into developing these self-driving cars could go to several better causes and research opportunities. While it is true that we should invest in technological advancements, society needs to weigh the necessity of such inventions. A self-driving car is an expensive luxury that does not have a direct benefit on society as a whole. It is reported that the cost to implement such new technological advancements into self-driving cars is around $100,000. This is a significant amount of money that is going to a societal ""want"" rather than a societal ""need"". Self-driving cars are a futuristic luxury concept at best, and in the today's society there are much more noble and helpful causes that this money could go to. For instance, the money that would be spent on these self-driving cars could be better spent researching life threatening diseases and other issues that are a current threat to society. It has been reported that several medical research endeavors that have significant promise for the advancement of human health are being underfunded. The money that is being funneled into the development of self-driving cars is, in turn, taking funds away from possible medical advancements that could save millions of human lives. 
	While these are only a handful scenarios of thousands, it is clear that self-driving cars lack the human instinct and decision-making that no form of algorithm can replicate. Self-driving cars also lack a necessity in society and the luxury of these items is not worth the potential toll they could have on society. With several unknowns and the high risks associated self-driving cars it is prudent and safest to avoid implementing self-driving cars into society as their various potential negative outcomes seem to significantly outweigh the benefits that they would have on society."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_31.txt,"
The self-driving car revolution promises to transform our daily lives by optimizing three crucial aspects: time, money, and safety. To evaluate this technology, let's examine each of these factors:

**Safety**
* The U.S. Department of Transportation values a human life at $9.2 million, highlighting the significance of reducing accidents.
* Human error accounts for 81% of accidents, which self-driving cars can mitigate by:
	+ Avoiding distractions from fellow passengers.
	+ Enabling independent travel for the differently-abled.
	+ Automatically adhering to safety rules: no drunk driving and strict speed limits.

**Time Efficiency**
* Sophisticated algorithms in self-driving cars calculate optimal distances between vehicles, facilitate inter-vehicle communication, and implement platooning to reduce traffic congestion.
* This can significantly save time otherwise wasted on waiting for public transport and navigating through congested routes.

**Financial Benefits**
* Self-driving cars eliminate the need for hired drivers.
* They reduce the likelihood of costly speed tickets and lower health insurance premiums.
* In the event of an accident, the fault lies with the machine, thereby shifting insurance and legal concerns to the auto-car company.

**Challenges and Limitations:**

1. **Prohibitive Cost**: The initial implementation cost of up to $100,000 is unaffordable for most Americans.
2. **Knowledge Gap**: Drivers need education on this new technology to handle system failures, as highlighted by Teletrac.
3. **Network Dependency**: Inclement weather can disrupt GPS and traffic signal connectivity, impairing safe operation.
4. **Adaptation to Local Laws and Special Scenarios**: Self-driving cars must comply with state-specific driving laws and manage unusual situations like manual traffic direction by officers in big cities.

**Conclusion**
After weighing the pros and cons, the benefits of self-driving cars significantly outweigh the drawbacks. Inspired by the trusted use of similar technology in autopilot airplanes, automatic people movers, and satellites, these cars can make instantaneous decisions to navigate traffic, signals, routes, and parking efficiently. Given the alarming rate of road accidents, this technology offers a promising solution, particularly for individuals in urgent need of care who live alone. Statistics unequivocally show humans are prone to error, leading to accidents, health issues, and insurance claims. In contrast, self-driving cars minimize distractions, accidents, and the resultant insurance needs, ultimately saving lives, time, and money while making our lives faster and safer.","The self-driving cars promise to take care of our time,money and safety. This new technology can be judged using the following factors:
Safety,the U.S. Department of Transportation assigns 9.2 million$ to each human life.81% of the accidents occur due to human error.  It can not get distracted by fellow passengers. Moreover, people like differently-abled can travel alone with these cars. They will follow the rules like: no drunk driving and speed limit, automatically reducing the likelihood of an accident.
 Time,These cars use complex algorithms to calculate distance between two cars, they can communicate with each other and also follow platooning to decrease traffic congestion.This can help in saving the time wasted in waiting for public transport and routes too.
	Money, they remove the added costs of hiring a driver, along with the costly speed tickets and hefty health insurances.
the need to hire a driver is totally null. In case of an accident, the fault will be of a machine, the insurance cover and the cops will be the concern of the auto-car company. 
The negative sides are discussed as follows:
Costly: this technology implementation takes upto $100,000.This is not possible for most Americans.
Low Knowledge: Teletrac quotes that drivers need to be taught this new technology. In case of a system failure, they should know the skills to operate it.
High dependency on network: in case of bad weather conditions, these cars might lose contact from gps or traffic signals. Then they will just not be able to work safely.
Local driving laws and special scenarios: these cars need to adapt to the driving laws as per the state. There are times when the traffic signals are switched off and traffic is manually managed by an officer. In fact, in big cities where people drive rashly, these cars might still be prone to accidents.
After weighing both sides of the coin, the pros tremendously outshine the cons. The auto-pilot mode in airplanes, automatic people movers (trains at airports) and not to forget satellites trust this technology. These cars need to make decisions instantaneously to manage traffic, signals,route and nearest parking. Considering the horrible numbers of road accidents, this technology is a very good option.The most important use might be for a person in need to urgent care living alone. 
All the statistics point towards the fact that humans are prone to error. The drivers might get distracted and lose control of the car. This will lead to accident, therefore health and car insurance covers. If a self-driving car is used, there will be no distractions, very less accidents, and very less insurance covers will be required. It will save our lives, time , money and make our lives faster and more safer."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_69.txt,"Self-driving cars are the future, or at least that’s what tech and driving companies like Uber and Google are telling us. The 33,000 fatalities per year caused by car accidents might be able to be reduced. However, self-driving cars present many technology barriers and potential disadvantages. Is it actually worth it to society to implement self-driving cars? 
	There are many benefits of self-driving cars. Humans are not perfect, but computers can be better than humans at one specified task – such as driving. Human error, especially from distractions at the wheel, causes 81% of car accidents, and use of computers will remove human error completely from the equation. In addition, computers can calculate when to stop, slow down or speed up, turn, and more, which is safer and more appropriate than a human’s quick guesstimation. Computers can also be programmed to always be defensive drivers; unlike people, who range from defensive to offensive in their driving styles. Because of this, self-driving cars would reduce accidents, resulting in reduced health and insurance costs for society. In addition, these calculations could improve traffic due to a behavior called platooning. This would allow people to have more time to do work or spend their time in more enjoyable ways while traveling instead of staring down a drab highway. As pointed out by a Forbes article, there is a cost savings associated with time, such as time spent driving. Lastly, suggested by the New York Times, self-driving cars could help disabled or elderly individuals get around. 
	However, self-driving cars do have drawbacks. Humans would still need to know how to operate them, according to Teletrac, and the cost of implementation is high. Current estimations of costs of a self-driving car is more than $100,000, much more than what people spend today on a car. All of society would need to adopt the technology, and trust the technology, otherwise accidents would still occur with people still on the road. In addition, this technology would be at a high risk for hacking and data breaches, as noted by The Guardian, who claims that the nefarious hackers would be very interested in the technology. Self-driving cars could also eliminate transportation sector jobs, impacting the economy and increasing the unemployment rate. Finally, if an accident happened, who would be to blame - man or machine? And if an accident did happen, how would the cars interpret temporary human traffic signals? Would humans even know how to operate cars anymore, or would they be stuck until the cause of the accident is fixed? 
	Yes, there are many drawbacks to self-driving cars. This includes the obstacle of getting the technology to do what we want it to do, the bigger obstacle of implementing this large change into society and infrastructure, and risks of fully depending on technology for transportation. However, the pros of self-driving cars outweigh the cons. All great technology developments of history have obstacles in technology and implementation. All dependence on technology has risks. This situation is no different from the developments of the first cars or airplanes or even cell phones. We stand to risk nothing and win nothing, or reap the benefits of saving lives, reducing traffic, allowing all to have transportation, and more. We just have to take this risk.
	When I think of the future, I imagine everything as automated. This includes automatic transportation, such as the use of self-driving cars. Although current technology is a long way away from fully automated transportation, I am confident that human society will get there. Flying in planes initially seemed impossible, but is now done by millions of people every day. Self-driving cars will one day be the same - once thought impossible, but eventually taken for granted. Even though there are many drawbacks, such as challenges in technology, implementation, and worst-case scenarios when technology goes wrong or is hacked, the benefits – reduced accidents, saving human lives, less traffic, and better transportation for all – are well worth the risk.","

Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize the transportation landscape, as touted by tech and driving giants like Uber and Google. With approximately 33,000 fatalities per year attributed to car accidents, the potential for reduction is substantial. However, the implementation of self-driving cars is not without its technological hurdles and drawbacks. The question remains: do the benefits to society outweigh the costs of adopting this innovative technology?

**The Advantages of Self-Driving Cars**

1. **Error Reduction and Enhanced Safety**: Unlike humans, computers excel in singular tasks, such as driving. By eliminating human error, which accounts for 81% of car accidents, self-driving cars significantly reduce the risk of accidents. Computers can also optimize driving decisions, embracing a universally defensive driving style.
2. **Economic and Time-Related Benefits**: Reduced accidents translate to lower health and insurance costs. Additionally, the ""platooning"" behavior of self-driving cars can improve traffic flow, freeing up time for more productive or leisurely activities. As highlighted by Forbes, there's a tangible cost savings associated with the time saved.
3. **Inclusivity for All**: Self-driving cars, as suggested by The New York Times, offer a vital means of transportation for disabled or elderly individuals, enhancing their independence.

**The Drawbacks and Challenges**

1. **Operational Knowledge and High Implementation Costs**: Despite the benefits, individuals would still need basic operational knowledge, and the initial cost of a self-driving car is estimated to exceed $100,000, as per current projections.
2. **Universal Adoption and Trust**: Widespread adoption is crucial to maximize safety benefits, and building trust in the technology is paramount.
3. **Cybersecurity Risks**: The sophisticated technology poses a high risk for hacking and data breaches, as noted by The Guardian.
4. **Job Market Impact**: The potential elimination of transportation sector jobs could negatively affect the economy and unemployment rates.
5. **Liability Concerns**: In the event of an accident, determining blame and interpreting temporary human signals pose significant challenges.

**Embracing the Future**

While the obstacles are undeniable, the advantages of self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages. History shows that groundbreaking technologies, from the first cars and airplanes to cell phones, have always faced similar challenges. The potential to save lives, reduce traffic congestion, and provide universal access to transportation makes the risks worthwhile. 

In envisioning the future, a fully automated world, including transportation, seems inevitable. Just as flying, once deemed impossible, is now a mundane aspect of life, self-driving cars will follow suit. Despite the challenges in technology, implementation, and the risks associated with dependency on technology, the benefits of reduced accidents, saved lives, lessened traffic, and enhanced transportation for all make the pursuit of self-driving cars a risk worth taking."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_5.txt,"When Back to the Future I and II were released in the 80's, many people were captivated by the technology showed throughout the films. Even though technology has greatly advanced within the last decade, it still has not reached the status of flying cars and floating hover boards. As we inch closer to 2020, the idea of having such technology does not seem impossible anymore. Olivier Garret stated in a Forbes article that he believed 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020, and one out of four cars will be self-driving by 2030. Although Back to the Future II predicted cars flying in 2015, the estimate of 2020 for self-driving cars is not that far off. 
	Within the past year, companies like Ford, Honda, BMW and Tesla are some of the automakers that are pushing for self-driving technology. This makes complete sense as technology is increasing forward and will continue to do so as long as there is a need for it. However, there are many drawbacks when implementing something so new and different. There is not a lot of previous data or research to consult with. If an error/accident occurs, it will be difficult to pinpoint the problem. It would be very hard to distinguish if the problem lies with individual car or if it encompasses all self-driving cars. Problems like this will eventually be answered, but it is going to take some time before it can be done efficiently. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages because technology is improving constantly, and there is a need for better transportation. The modes of transportation that are available now work decently, but can always be improved. As a result, society is better off by using self-driving cars because it provides more opportunities and resources that can help improve human life. 
	The best advantage of self-driving cars is to overall reduce human error. Human error is known to be a cause of major accidents, especially when a driver is trying to multi-task and focus on other things besides driving. Although it is easy to forget, the human brain is not a machine. It is an organ that responds uniquely to problems and can produce multiple solutions. A machine differs from the brain because it has a set algorithm programmed to provide an expected solution. There is no wrong solution as the only appropriate solution is already being used. Self-driving cars can help reduce accidents caused by humans since they do not have an inclination to be distracted. The machine has one job and it does it efficiently. As a result, drivers will no longer be distracted when multi-tasking. In addition to reducing human error, self-driving cars will provide more opportunities by providing transportation to those who cannot drive.  
	All in all, technological advances are going to occur as we become smarter as a species. When technology advances too far too quickly, there can be some concerns about the quality of the product and its functionality.
	Potential problems/disadvantages of self-driving cars include an increased rate in unemployment. Driving instructors, DMV tellers and employees of companies like Uber and Lyft, will definitely suffer as there will be less of a demand for those services. Self-driving cars can complete tasks more safely and efficiently than humans. As self-driving cars increase, the amount of jobs available will decrease. Although this is an important concern, technology failure (i.e. glitches), would be an even greater problem. Accidents could be more fatal and insurance rates might increase to account for that. It would not be surprising if insurance companies came up with required coverage for autonomous cars. Instead of purchasing just a basic insurance plan, insurance companies would have the ability to raise the price however they want. Auto insurance companies already receive way too much money, but if there was a way to get two for the price of one, many people would be more likely to get a self-driving car. 
	Overall, self-driving cars have many benefits and are an integral part of society. They can make the roads safer, provide more opportunities, and most importantly, save lives. As ambitious as it may be, having 10 million cars on the road by 2020 is not impossible and surprisingly, it might happen sooner than we think.","

When iconic films like Back to the Future I and II debuted in the 80's, they captivated audiences with futuristic technologies, including flying cars and hoverboards. Although we have not yet reached those heights, the last decade's rapid advancements bring us closer to another predicted innovation: self-driving cars. Olivier Garret's Forbes article forecasted 10 million self-driving cars on the road by 2020, and one in four cars being self-driving by 2030. While we missed the 2015 flying car prediction, the 2020 estimate for self-driving cars seems increasingly plausible.

Recent years have seen automakers like Ford, Honda, BMW, and Tesla aggressively pursuing self-driving technology, a logical step given the relentless march of innovation driven by societal needs. However, implementing such groundbreaking technology also presents significant challenges, notably the lack of historical data and research. In the event of errors or accidents, pinpointing the source of the problem – whether specific to an individual car or systemic across all self-driving vehicles – will be arduous. Though these issues will eventually be resolved, time will be a crucial factor in achieving efficiency.

Despite these challenges, the advantages of self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages, thanks to the constant evolution of technology and the pressing need for improved transportation. Current modes of transportation are serviceable but ripe for enhancement. Consequently, adopting self-driving cars will enrich society by offering more opportunities and resources to enhance human life.

A primary benefit of self-driving cars is the drastic reduction of human error, a leading cause of major accidents, often resulting from multitasking. Unlike the human brain, with its unique problem-solving capabilities, machines follow predetermined algorithms, yielding consistent, predictable outcomes. By eliminating distractions, self-driving cars can significantly decrease accidents caused by human lapse. Additionally, they will provide transportation for those unable to drive, further expanding their societal benefit.

In conclusion, as our species' intelligence grows, so does technology. While rapid advancements can raise quality and functionality concerns, they also propel us forward. 

Potential drawbacks of self-driving cars include increased unemployment among driving instructors, DMV employees, and ride-sharing service workers, as demand for these services dwindles. Moreover, technological failures could lead to more severe accidents and potentially inflated insurance rates, prompting the creation of specialized, more expensive coverage plans for autonomous vehicles. However, these concerns are mitigated by the overarching benefits.

Ultimately, self-driving cars, with their potential to enhance road safety, provide new opportunities, and most critically, save lives, are poised to become an integral part of our society. The ambitious goal of having 10 million self-driving cars on the road by 2020, while challenging, may be achieved sooner than anticipated."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_60.txt,"The most notable advantages to self-driving cars are the elimination of human error and distracted driving, which cause a majority of car accidents; redistribution of the time people spend driving to other tasks, such as reading, chatting, and eating; and provision of a safe and independent mode of transportation for people with disabilities, elderly adults, and intoxicated individuals who may be unable to drive. However, security risks, exorbitant prices, and limited adaptation abilities provide compelling evidence against the case for self-driving cars. 
	A large consideration, especially when considering technological advances, is the safety of our personal data as consumers. Hackers and large companies could gain an incredible amount of information through self-driving cars, and likely because of the newness of the technology, there are little to no security measures in place to protect us from these security threats, according to Egil Juliussen, the Director of Research for infotainment and advanced driver assistance for IHS Automotive. 
	In addition, because of the $100,000 cost, a widespread decrease in car accidents can never be attained. In order for self-driving cars to thrive and for us to experience their benefits, they must be the majority on the road, and based on the current socioeconomic climate in the United States, this will not be the case. The $100,000 price point includes sensors, software, engineering, and power and computer requirements, and it will likely be a major deterrent to people buying self-driving cars. 
	My final concern is the self-driving car's inability to adapt to situations such as traffic signal failures, inclement weather, and inaccurate GPS mapping. A simple solution is for a driver to enter a manual mode during scenarios such as these, but drivers may not respond quickly enough, particularly if they are using their newfound free time to eat, talk, or read. More dangerously, people with impairments due to age, ability, or intoxication may not be equipped to maneuver the vehicle. Lastly, in the case of GPS inaccuracy, which many users can attest to, a driver may not realize that their car is taking them in the wrong direction, turning down a one-way street, or avoiding a road that does not appear to exist in the data. 
	Overall, the risks associated with self-driving cars eclipse the benefits. Despite the luxury of enjoying more free time or the promise of increased accessibility to owning and operating a vehicle, self-driving cars are not a reliable mode of transportation. They are vulnerable to hackers and machine-error, and are not projected to actually benefit our communities until their use is widespread, which is problematic due to their widely inaccessible pricing.","

The introduction of self-driving cars presents a paradox, offering substantial benefits while also raising significant concerns. On one hand, they promise to eradicate human error and distracted driving, the primary causes of most car accidents; liberate time for occupants to engage in other activities; and provide a safe, independent transportation solution for the disabled, elderly, and intoxicated individuals. On the other hand, formidable obstacles include inherent security risks, prohibitively expensive pricing, and limited adaptability.

A pressing concern in the context of emerging technologies is the safeguarding of personal consumer data. Self-driving cars could potentially yield a vast amount of information to hackers and large corporations, with Egil Juliussen, Director of Research for Infotainment and Advanced Driver Assistance at IHS Automotive, highlighting the lack of robust security measures to mitigate these threats, given the technology's novelty.

Furthermore, the hefty $100,000 price tag poses a significant barrier to widespread adoption, a prerequisite for realizing a considerable decrease in car accidents. This cost, attributed to advanced sensors, sophisticated software, engineering, power, and computer requirements, is likely to deter many potential buyers, especially considering the current socioeconomic landscape in the United States.

Another critical issue is the self-driving car's struggle to adapt to unforeseen situations, such as traffic signal failures, inclement weather, and inaccuracies in GPS mapping. While engaging a manual mode might offer a solution, this could prove challenging, especially for drivers utilizing their newfound leisure time or those with impairments. Notably, in cases of GPS inaccuracy, drivers might remain unaware of being misdirected, exacerbating potential dangers.

In conclusion, a nuanced assessment reveals that the risks associated with self-driving cars currently outweigh their benefits. Despite the allure of additional leisure time and enhanced accessibility, these vehicles are compromised by vulnerabilities to hacking and mechanical error, coupled with a price point that makes widespread adoption, and thus tangible community benefits, improbable in the near future."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_37.txt,"In today's society, we are seeing the start of a new era in technology where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming mainstream, and so is our reliance on them. Examples of this can be found in our homes, social media, everyday retail, and other facets of our lives. 
	Many dystopian books and films would like you to believe that the steady integration of AI is the start of our societal downfall, but this is simply not the case--take self-driving cars for example. For those of you who are unfamiliar, self-driving cars are vehicles that rely on AI to give itself directions and to literally drive itself without any human interaction. 
	In general, this is a great improvement to driving safety as it can provide a much secure form of driving. Humans are easily fallible--they get distracted, they get sleepy, and they can choose to drive while under the influence--which can drastically increases the chance of accidents. Computers, however, are literally unable to succumb to such mistakes and are therefore safer. 
	Additionally, computers are able to communicate with other computers easily, unlike humans who have no form of communication with any of the other drivers in close proximity. This advantage allows computers in self-driving cars to sense each other within seconds and negotiate the road together. 
	However, many people think that if we were to rely on these AI-driven cars, it would become a gradual demise for us. Self-driving cars are hackable. They can be fooled. And they rely on people en masse to ""opt-in"" and buy their own self-driving cars, otherwise a single self-driving car cannot communicate with a vehicle which cannot ""talk back.""
	But what these naysayers are forgetting is that all of these downfalls can be remedied with time--we are only seeing the beginning of this new stage in automation. It is a natural process to introduce new technology into society and wait for newer models to come out until it is perfected. By dismissing the new technology in its early stages without giving it the chance to improve with time would be like telling a child to stop practicing at something because they were awful in the beginning. 
	Here is a simple example of how we can slowly rely on technology to assist us: traffic lights. Way before we relied on traffic lights to help guide us through intersections, we had traffic guards to help us. But over time, we allowed ourselves to accept traffic lights, instead of a human, to help us through. And of course, the traffic light wasn't perfect or even similar to the version we have today! It also had a simpler code and fewer systems to help us, but we let it stay up and now we have near-perfect traffic light controls and coordination systems. 
	The point is, the more we work on this technology, the safer it will become, but only if we give it a chance to grow and perfect itself. This is not to say that the negative points aren't valid or accurate observations on the current self-driving cars we have today. But we tend to forget that this is not an indication of what it could be. Of what it could provide for us. And how helpful and much safer it could actually be for us in the long-term. 
        Manufacturers, scientists, and computer scientists alike will develop new software updates to prevent its hackability. Will improve upon its spatial awareness and its adaptability in order for the programs to be fooled as easily. And with further improvement, the more common the technology will become and cause its pricepoint to decrease, which in turn will make self-driving cars much more accessible and allow a wider population to purchase their own.
	There is also the concern about the start of a dystopian-like society. ""What if we become too reliant on our technology, and then it decides to just stop working or turn against us?"" To that, I say: science-fiction is still science-fiction. Just because we learned how to use a calculator does not mean we have stopped learning mathematics in school. Just because we have the autopilot feature in planes does not mean we do not stop teaching pilots how to fly. And just because we give cars the knowledge of the road does not mean that all of a sudden it is going to drive off without us.
	But I will definitely tell you this: stick shift deserves to become forgotten and buried forever, and if you are one of the few who miss such a time, then maybe self-driving cars were never meant for you to begin with.","
In today's society, we're witnessing the dawn of an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous, transforming various facets of our lives, including homes, social media, retail, and more. 
	While dystopian narratives might portray AI integration as the precursor to societal downfall, the reality is more nuanced, as exemplified by self-driving cars. For the uninitiated, these vehicles utilize AI to navigate and drive without human intervention, significantly enhancing road safety. 
	Humans are inherently fallible, prone to distractions, fatigue, and reckless behavior, which substantially increases accident risks. In contrast, computers are immune to such errors, ensuring a safer driving experience. 
	Furthermore, computers can seamlessly communicate with each other, a capability that eludes human drivers. This enables self-driving cars to rapidly sense and coordinate with nearby vehicles, streamlining traffic flow. 
	Detractors argue that relying on AI-driven cars would lead to a gradual decline, citing concerns about hackability, vulnerabilities, and the need for widespread adoption. However, these drawbacks can be mitigated over time, as is typical with emerging technologies. 
	To illustrate this natural process, consider the evolution of traffic lights, which replaced human traffic guards and have since become refined and efficient. Similarly, self-driving cars will improve with ongoing development, enhanced safety features, and reduced costs, making them more accessible to a broader population. 
	Manufacturers, scientists, and experts will continually update software to prevent hacking, enhance spatial awareness, and adaptability, addressing current limitations. 
	Regarding concerns about over-reliance on technology, it's essential to distinguish between science fiction and reality. The integration of technology in various domains (e.g., calculators in math, autopilot in aviation) has not diminished our fundamental skills, but rather augmented them. 
	In conclusion, as self-driving cars continue to advance, they will undoubtedly revolutionize transportation, making it safer and more efficient. While nostalgia for traditional driving methods, like stick shift, may persist, the benefits of this innovation will likely render such sentiments obsolete."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_61.txt,"Self driving cars have become the craze of the  new world. Not only would they be fuel efficient and reduce the number of accidents on the road, it would also allow the driver the opportunity to interact with their friends in the car instead of focusing on the road. Transportation by car would instead be similar to a train where you can leisurely admire the view and chat with friends while you cruise towards the destination. However, self driving cars are not infallible. Leaving our lives to the decisions of a machine is no simple task. Should the technology  fail, will the drivers who lack practice be able to handle the situation. Being suddenly thrown into such a situation would cause the driver to panic and be more prone to causing accidents. Overall, until this technology proves to be almost fail proof, it will most likely not be widely accepted or implemented. In the following paragraph I will be explaining why it is a good stepping stone to the future. 
	Self driving cars are the way to the future. It would greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road. Over 90 percent of road accidents are attributed to human error, by employing self driving cars, we will eliminate the human error which is the key cause of many road accidents that occur today. By taking the human out of driving, there will be less chances of misjudgments because a machine does what it is programmed. 
	However, self driving cars depend heavily on the accuracy of the instruments it has, something which our current technology lacks. The GPS which we often use today to get to our destination are not very reliable. One example of its unreliability is whenever there are overlapping roads, the GPS is unable to identify which road we are on and would give conflicting instructions. Furthermore, GPS do not work underground and in tunnels, affecting available routes of self driving cars. The inaccuracy of the device could lead to inefficiencies and longer travelling times to accommodate the restrictions and issues mentioned above. The weather itself could also hamper the accuracy of the GPS, disrupting the performance of the self driving car. With so many disruptions and inaccuracies, self driving cars would not be able to operate efficiently and thus may perform worse than simply driving the car.  
	In order to counter the above problem, some may suggest that we use more sophisticated and accurate instruments in our vehicles. However, these technologies would cause the cost of purchasing these car to be astronomical. This would limit the number of self driving cars on the road and affect the accuracy of driving as self driving cars rely upon information provided by other self driving cars. With less information about its surrounding vehicles, it will not be able to accurately judge the situation and thus result in poorer performance. This is a major issue as not only are we paying highly for such a product, but also the product fails to meet the expectations of the user. Both these facts combined would greatly hamper the interest of buyer. Thus with such a high  barrier of entry and no current advantage now, self driving cars would not be a very viable option. 
	Overall, self driving cars are a good step ahead but unless the level of technology improves in price and accuracy, it would only be a fairy tale.","

Self-driving cars have revolutionized the transportation landscape, promising enhanced fuel efficiency, reduced accidents, and a transformed in-car experience. By automating driving, passengers can engage with each other or enjoy the scenery, akin to traveling by train. However, reliance on technology raises concerns. The potential for system failure and the ensuing lack of driver preparedness could lead to panic and increased accident risk. Widespread adoption seems unlikely until the technology approaches near infallibility.

**Embracing the Future with Caution**

Self-driving cars represent a pivotal step towards a safer future, with the potential to drastically reduce the over 90% of road accidents attributed to human error. By removing human judgment from the driving equation, machines can execute pre-programmed instructions flawlessly. 

**The Challenge of Technological Limitations**

However, the efficacy of self-driving cars heavily relies on the accuracy of their instruments, a facet where current technology falls short. The unreliability of GPS systems, evident in their struggle with overlapping roads, underground tunnels, and inclement weather, poses significant challenges. These inaccuracies could lead to inefficiencies and longer travel times, potentially outperforming manual driving in terms of poor performance.

**The Conundrum of Upgrading Technology**

Proposed solutions involving more sophisticated instruments would exponentially increase vehicle costs, limiting the number of self-driving cars on the road. This, in turn, would compromise the collective intelligence of the self-driving network, reliant on data from fellow vehicles to navigate effectively. The high entry barrier coupled with unmet expectations would deter potential buyers, rendering self-driving cars a less viable option at present.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while self-driving cars are a forward-thinking innovation, their viability hinges on overcoming the dual hurdles of affordability and technological precision. Until these challenges are addressed, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars will remain an aspirational vision for the future. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_33.txt,"
Technology permeates every aspect of modern life, from smartphones and WiFi to social media. The rapid advancement of technology is poised to revolutionize transportation with the emergence of self-driving cars, as evidenced by Google's ongoing testing. However, the question remains: would these cars truly be beneficial to society? While some argue that self-driving cars are safer due to reduced human error, I contend that their significantly higher costs outweigh their potential benefits.

**Safety Concerns vs. Costs**

* **Proponents' Argument:** With over 33,000 annual fatalities from car accidents, self-driving cars could mitigate human error-induced accidents. Computer-driven vehicles, utilizing complex algorithms, would minimize distractions and enhance road awareness, potentially reducing healthcare and insurance costs (estimated at $9.2 million per human life).
* **Counterargument:** Self-driving cars would not eradicate human error entirely, as they can still be vulnerable to significant human oversight. Moreover, these vehicles pose a threat to personal security due to the risk of hacking, compromising passengers' sensitive information.

**Economic Implications**

* **Job Market Impact:** Widespread adoption of self-driving cars would lead to substantial job losses in the public transportation sector, exacerbating unemployment rates and potentially triggering economic decline.
* **Additional Costs:** Implementing self-driving cars would necessitate significant investments in education, vehicle acquisition, and operation. The occurrence of accidents, despite being reduced, would still lead to complex and costly legal disputes over liability.

**Conclusion**

While technology simplifies and complicates life simultaneously, the impending reality of self-driving cars raises crucial concerns. Despite potential safety improvements, I firmly believe that the exorbitant costs, job market disruption, and inherent dangers associated with self-driving cars outweigh their benefits, potentially causing more harm than good. ","Technology is a huge part of daily living. It seems like society relies heavily on cell phones, WiFi, and different forms of social media. Technology is advancing so quickly, that soon even our cars will be made ""smart"". A world with self driving cars might not be too far off for us, as Google has been testing cars that indeed drive themselves. But, are these cars really more beneficial for us as a society? Some may argue that these self driving cars are much safer than our current modes of transportation. I hold with the opinion that these cars would not be more beneficial because they would occur with significantly higher costs than those of human driven cars. 
	It has been shown that upwards of 33,000 people die annually from car accidents, and many people believe that these self driving cars can be the resolution. Car accidents are often caused by human error, like distractions. Many people in support of self driving cars may argue that since these cars are ran by computers, they are unable to become distracted, significantly lowering the probability of fatal car accidents. These cars are ran by complex algorithms that allow the car to be aware of its surroundings. These algorithms would allow for the cars to know the locations of stop lights, as well as distances between itself and other cars on the road. It is proposed that the value of a human life is around 9.2 million dollars, and with a decrease in fatal car accidents, a significant decrease in health care and insurance costs would follow if self driving cars were used regularly. 
	Despite the great arguments in support of self driving cars, these cars would not completely eliminate the risk of human error, nor would they be the most secure methods of transportation.  Firstly, although these cars would decrease the occurrence of human error, they can still be accompanied with significantly high amounts of  human error. With these errors, fatal accidents can, and most definitely will happen if self driven cars are made the norm. These self driven cars are also unsafe because they pose a threat to personal security. These cars are operated on computer programming and software, which can be open to hackers that could collect personal information from the passengers.
       These self driving cars are also very costly. The use of self driving cars would be damaging to the economy as a whole. Workers in the public transportation sector would be put out of work, because there would be no need for them in the job market, causing a rise in the unemployment rate and economic decline. Education in how to use, acquire, and operate these vehicles would also be a significant cost. As previously stated, these accidents do not completely eliminate the occurrence of accidents, and if these accidents were to occur can be accompanied with high court costs, because  messy situation would arise when trying to figure out who would be responsible for the damage. 
	Technology is very important. It makes life a little more simple, yet complicates it all at once. Self driving cars might sound like something that would only exist in a movie, but these vehicles will soon actually become a thing of reality. Although some may argue that these cars would improve overall safety and quality of life, I strongly believe that they would be more costly than regular cars and could potentially cause more harm than good. Self driving cars can be dangerous, and will possibly damage the job market."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_26.txt,"There has been much discussion on the topic of self driving cars recently. Many people think that allowing self driving cars on the road would be a bad idea. They worry about things such as liability in case of accidents, and loss of jobs for truck drivers and others employed in the automotive industry. However, self driving cars are the way of the future; the pros of having self driving cars on the road vastly outweigh the cons. The effects of self driving cars will benefit society in a multitude of ways, and will allow mankind to advance further in technology and science alike. 
	There are many ways the advent of self driving cars will be beneficial to mankind. For example, people can get easily distracted while driving, which is one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents in the United States as of today. However it is not possible for a computer to become distracted, it does not have personality or curiosity like humans do; thus, if computers controlled the wheel, accidents on the road would decline greatly. This has more implications than just saving human life, there would be a significant fiscal advantage as well. Right now there is 9.2 million dollars saved for motor vehicle accidents, however if the roads became safer, then less of this money would need to be allocated for accidents and could be used in other areas. Additionally, many cars even have features that resemble early stages of self driving cars; most cars have object sensors, autonomous breaking, and many other driver-less car like features. Consequently, the step to fully autonomous cars is not actually as big as some critics may believe. As seen by these few examples, self driving cars have immense potential to help society, and therefore we should be more open to release them in public. 
	Even with all of the benefits that self driving cars have to offer, there are still some critiques. For example, people worry that passengers may not have the skills needed to operate cars (why would you learn how to drive a car if it drove itself?), and if there was a glitch, it may turn into a serious issue. However, there could easily be regulations enacted that would require drivers to take a test every year or so, to ensure that they can take over in the case of an emergency. Just as drivers have to prove they can drive a car today, they would have to do the same in the future. Another common concern is the cars driving ability in hazardous weather conditions. Some sensors can be notably damaged by heavy rain and wind. This concern is not as serious as it may seem however. If there was regulation passed to make sure humans still knew how to drive, than they could just take over during inclement weather. Furthermore, if the weather conditions were that dangerous, than it would not be advisable to go driving anyway! Though people may have concerns about the effects of self driving cars on society, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will harm.
I imagine a future where kids can play outside safely, without worrying about a ball rolling onto a busy street, a world where parents did not have to fear that their newly initiated teenage driver would make it to his friend in one piece, and a place that has enough money to upkeep public transportation and roads. This world that I imagine, and that I hope you imagine too, can come as a direct followup from self driving cars. Self driving cars are not perfect yet, and there are still many issues to be worked out. Despite this, I believe that with all the potential benefits that self driving cars can bring to society, they should be not only adopted, but embraced. They can help with many different aspects of society, but only if we let them.","
There has been intense debate recently surrounding the implementation of self-driving cars on public roads. While concerns about liability, job loss for truck drivers, and automotive industry employees are valid, the benefits of self-driving cars far outweigh these drawbacks. The integration of self-driving cars will have a profoundly positive impact on society, driving technological and scientific advancements.

One significant advantage of self-driving cars is the drastic reduction in motor vehicle accidents, primarily caused by human distraction. Unlike humans, computers are immune to distraction, lacking personality and curiosity. This would lead to a substantial decrease in accidents, saving countless lives and allocating the current $9.2 million reserved for motor vehicle accidents to other vital areas. Moreover, many modern cars already feature preliminary self-driving technologies, such as object sensors and autonomous braking, making the transition to fully autonomous vehicles less daunting.

Despite the potential benefits, concerns persist. Critics worry about passengers' ability to operate vehicles in case of glitches or emergencies. Implementing annual driving tests to ensure competence would easily mitigate this issue, mirroring current licensing requirements. Another concern is the vehicles' performance in hazardous weather conditions, which could damage sensors. However, with regulations in place for human intervention during such conditions, and considering the inadvisability of driving in extreme weather, this concern is manageable.

Envisioning a future with self-driving cars, we see a world where children can play safely, parents worry less about their teenagers' driving, and public transportation and roads receive adequate funding. Although self-driving cars are not yet perfect, with many issues still to be resolved, their potential benefits to society are undeniable. I firmly believe that self-driving cars should not only be adopted but also embraced, as they hold the key to positively transforming various aspects of our society, if we allow them to.@

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_25.txt,"This article on self driving cars was interesting because it introduced arguments that I hadn't considered before. Obviously, self driving cars would help decrease the number of accidents that are caused purely by human error. However, now we face the uncharted territory of vehicular accidents caused by mechanical error. Automobile accidents cause thousands of premature deaths every year in our country.  From distracted driving to driving under the influence, public health officials lead several efforts to encourage safe driving in attempt to decrease accidents.  However, with the development of new technology, some wonder if the use of self driving cars would aid in the decrease of automobile accidents.  When reading the article, I was able to empathize with both sides of the argument.
	One of the arguments in favor of self driving cars would be that they can help decrease the number of accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. There are many heart breaking stories of death or serious injury resulting from persons under the influence getting behind the wheel. The development, popularity and affordability of Uber and Lyft has made getting around easier.  They are widely used by people that have been out drinking and are not able to drive home.  However, we still have the problem of intoxicated driving in our country.  The article believes that the development of self driving cars would help decrease the number of accidents caused by drunk drivers.  I can agree with this prediction.  Even though Uber and Lyft are usually reasonably priced, there may be people that are confident in their driving abilities and do not want to pay someone else to drive them.  Potentially, self driving cars would enable these people to get home safer because they would not be responsible for operating the vehicle.  In a perfect world, I believe that self driving cars could be a great solution to decreasing the number of automobile accidents in our country.  However, there is a lot of work that needs to happen before we praise the use of self driving cars. 
	I feel that the most complicated issue in regards to self driving cars was the issue of who to blame when can accident inevitably occurs. If a child runs out in front of a car and the car cannot detect it quickly enough and does not stop, who is at fault? I believe that many people would wonder if the accident could have been prevented if a human was behind the wheel. Would they have been able see the child out of their periphery and anticipate the child might run towards the road? Perhaps the accident could have been prevented. To add to this predicament, there will be people attempting to blame to manufacturer for visibility issues. Others may argue that the driver should have been paying attention to the road, even if they own a self driving car. I believe that there would need to be concrete rules about how active of a role the driver needs to play. Should the driver still be 100% focused on the road? This would be the optimal scenario for increasing safety because the human and the car would essentially be working together.  However, if this is the case, then it would negate the positive discussed in the preceding paragraph because drunk drivers would still not be allowed to operate the vehicle.
	From reading this article, I would have to say that, while self driving cars come with benefits,  I do not think we should work on replacing humans drivers entirely. I think that if the purpose is to make driving safer and minimize accidents, then drivers should also be 100% attentive to the road. Driving and traffic conditions are too complicated to leave to just a robot. There  are many last minute decisions that humans need to make that can save lives. A self driving car could provide too much comfort to drivers and perhaps lead to them being less cautious. A false sense of safety behind the wheel is extremely dangerous. I think that even with self driving cars, drivers should be held responsible for any accidents (unless there is a true manufacturing error that causes the accident) because I believe that the responsibility still falls on the human to operate the vehicle safely. I believe that the introduction of self driving cars would lead to confusion and frustration before it leads to the positive changes we want to observe.  Therefore, we should proceed cautiously while we continue to collect research and develop training methodologies for proper vehicle operations.","

This article on self-driving cars introduced novel arguments that warrant consideration. A key benefit of self-driving cars is their potential to decrease accidents caused by human error, which currently claim thousands of lives annually in our country. Despite efforts to promote safe driving, mechanical errors now pose a new concern. Here, I weigh both sides of the debate.

**A Pro: Reducing Accidents Caused by Intoxicated Drivers**
Self-driving cars could mitigate accidents involving drunk drivers, a persistent issue despite the rise of Uber and Lyft. Some individuals, confident in their driving abilities, might still drive under the influence, risking lives. Self-driving cars could provide a safer alternative for these individuals, assuming they would utilize the technology. In theory, this could decrease accident rates, but significant development and testing are needed before embracing self-driving cars as a solution.

**A Con: The Complexity of Assigning Blame**
A crucial concern with self-driving cars is determining liability in the event of an accident. If a child unexpectedly runs in front of a self-driving car that fails to stop, who is at fault? Would a human driver have prevented the accident through peripheral vision or anticipation? This dilemma raises questions about the driver's role in a self-driving vehicle. Should they remain fully attentive, essentially working in tandem with the car for optimal safety? If so, this negates the benefit for drunk drivers, as they would still be unable to operate the vehicle safely.

**A Balanced Perspective**
After considering the arguments, I believe we should not entirely replace human drivers with self-driving cars. To enhance safety and minimize accidents, drivers should remain 100% attentive. Driving conditions are too complex to rely solely on automation, requiring humans to make crucial, split-second decisions. Self-driving cars might induce a false sense of security, leading to decreased caution. Therefore, unless a manufacturing defect is the direct cause, drivers should be held accountable for accidents. The introduction of self-driving cars will likely lead to initial confusion and frustration. Consequently, we should proceed with caution, continuing to gather research and develop training methodologies for safe vehicle operation."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_77.txt,"The name, Self-Driving Car, in itself elicits advantages, but then also fear and therefore some disadvantages. The new technology's most important advantage is increasing the time that cars can drive close together while maintaining flowing traffic. The sensor, then, is more reliable than the human when judging the minimum distance cars can drive safely on the road together. This is because the sensor is objective and not distracted, while the human is subjective and distracted.The program determines the safe minimum distance and then as a result, more cars can be on the road at the same time without having slow car flow or slow traffic. As experience shows, sometimes humans misestimate the safe minimum distance and this can lead to wasted space on the road or car crashes. One can then see that not only can the roads be more efficient for travel, but also reduction in car crashes can make the roads less dangerous. 
	As mentioned before, the name, Self-Driving Cars, can also elicit fearer. One such fearer is the gasoline industry. Many in this field may reason that if the self-driving car is electric, the demand for gasoline will decline. Those who reason as such are not far from the truth. If there is less of a demand for gasoline fuel, these industries are indeed at risk for reduction in their net profit. Unfortunately, for advocates of the gasoline industry, the imagery of “new and improved” does include electricity as the new and improved from gasoline fuel. Many might come to recognize that electricity power is a form of “new and improved” because it is friendlier for the environment than “gasoline fuel.” 
	If one has lived long enough, one can recognize the value of good relationships not just with other people but also with the environment. It almost relates to the nature vs. nurture debate. Social and environmental factors determine our personalities. This opinion is important because Self-driving cars are beneficial to society because they improve the quality of environmental factors. In other words, Self-driving cars make the air “healthier” by reducing the carbon dioxide content. If there is more oxygen with which our bodies can produce energy, then in the long-term the people in this environment can have healthier states of homeostasis. For example, the reference paper argued that Self-driving cars would reduce the time that cars on the road. The fewer moments that cars are on the road lead to fewer turns of the energy cycle and then fewer instances of energy that is lost as heat or waste. This then can render the air more free of waste over time, and the people using the air healthier. 
	Finally, the increased frequency of an electric power source for electric cars and a diminished frequency of a ""dirty"" gasoline power source for normal cars would make the environment cleaner. Not only does the fuel affect air’s cleanliness but also land’s cleanliness. For example, I have mistakenly spilled gas on the floor while refueling my vehicle. An adjacent fire could make this ""careless” mistake into a great fire. This fire would affect land’s cleanliness. An unclean land can affect the inhabitants of the land. Self-driving cars can help prevent such incidents that can make the land unclean. A cleaner land and air can make the people healthier. Therefore, “Self driving cars” can help move society forward to better health. 
	For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several societal advantages to start sprouting, and one of those advantages is better health.","

The term ""Self-Driving Car"" inherently conveys both benefits and concerns. A primary advantage of this technology is its potential to increase traffic flow by safely reducing the distance between vehicles. Unlike humans, who are prone to subjective judgments and distractions, the sensor system objectively determines the minimum safe distance, enabling more cars to share the road without compromising traffic flow. This not only enhances travel efficiency but also reduces the risk of accidents, often caused by human misjudgments of safe distances.

Conversely, the advent of Self-Driving Cars, particularly if electric, sparks fear within the gasoline industry. A decrease in gasoline demand could indeed threaten the industry's profitability. However, the shift towards electricity aligns with the broader societal move towards environmental sustainability, recognizing electricity as a more eco-friendly alternative to gasoline.

The long-term benefits of Self-Driving Cars extend to environmental quality, which in turn, positively impacts human health. By reducing time spent on the road, these vehicles decrease energy consumption, minimizing heat waste and lowering carbon dioxide emissions. This leads to cleaner air, which is crucial for maintaining healthier states of homeostasis in individuals. Furthermore, the transition from gasoline to electric power sources not only purifies the air but also protects land from potential pollution, such as oil spills, thereby safeguarding the well-being of inhabitants.

Ultimately, the integration of Self-Driving Cars can significantly contribute to a cleaner environment, which is pivotal for the health and well-being of society. For these reasons, I firmly believe that Self-Driving Cars will usher in numerous societal benefits, paramount among them being improved public health.@

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_42.txt,"

On a fateful night, a group of friends, en route to celebrate my roommate's twenty-first birthday, swerved off a treacherous, windy road and suffered severe injuries. This incident underscored the perils of human error while driving, influenced by factors like fatigue, mental preoccupations, and irresponsible alcohol consumption.

Despite these risks, I argue against the widespread adoption of self-driven cars in our society, citing concerns over promoted mindlessness, significant job losses in transportation, and vulnerabilities to adverse weather conditions.

**Mindfulness and Responsibility**: Relying on self-driven cars could foster a lack of situational awareness, as passengers might neglect their surroundings, knowing they're not responsible for driving. This could encourage reckless behavior, undermining the importance of being present and attentive while on the road.

**Economic and Employment Impact**: Widespread adoption of self-driven cars would likely eliminate numerous jobs in public transportation, ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber, Lyft, taxi companies), and potentially devastate the car insurance industry. These sectors currently provide vital employment opportunities, contributing to the economy. Preserving these services supports workers and maintains convenience for non-drivers.

**Vulnerabilities and Limitations**: While computers are less prone to distraction (responsible for 81% of car crashes), they are not infallible. Self-driving cars face challenges from weather conditions, interactions with traditional vehicles, and potential misuse (e.g., by children). In emergencies, passengers might be unprepared to intervene safely. 

**Acknowledging Benefits**: Nonetheless, self-driving cars could significantly enhance mobility for individuals with disabilities, relying heavily on public transportation. Additionally, their electric operation would offer environmental benefits and cost savings for users.

**Conclusion**: Despite these innovative advantages, I remain cautious about adopting self-driven cars due to concerns over promoted irresponsibility, job displacement, and operational vulnerabilities. Ultimately, I believe individuals should retain the responsibility of informed decision-making while driving to ensure safety for themselves and others. The joy and calm of driving, shared by many, should not be underestimated.@

**Improvements Made:**

1. **Clarified Structure**: Introduced clear section headings for better argument flow.
2. **Enhanced Storytelling**: Briefly retold the introductory anecdote for impact.
3. **Streamlined Language**: Simplified sentence structures for clarity.
4. **Emphasized Key Points**: Used bold subtitles to highlight main arguments.
5. **Balanced View**: Maintained acknowledgment of both sides of the argument.
6. **Concise Conclusion**: Summarized the main concerns and personal stance.","On the night of my roommate’s twenty-first birthday, a group of her friends swerved on a windy and slippery road into a tree and were profoundly injured while on the way to meet us to celebrate. 
	There are many factors that influence our decisions when driving – how much rest we have had the night prior, the extraneous things we have on our minds that cause our attention to falter, and unfortunately, perhaps even the amount of alcohol we have consumed, if we are not making responsible decisions. 
	Despite the distractions that accompany traditional driving, I believe that we should not popularize self-driven cars in our society as it will promote a lack of mindfulness while traveling, it will eliminate many jobs in transportation, and it is vulnerable to weather conditions. 
	Utilizing self-driven cars would mean that the passenger does not have to pay attention while in the car, because the directions and destination are already mapped out for you. We are so busy in our everyday lives that we try to find methods to multi-task in any way possible. This engenders a lack of self-awareness and a lack of attention to the world around us. It is important to be present in all aspects of our lives; this should be especially true when on the road. That being said, self-driving cars could promote reckless behavior or mindlessness, as the driver would know they would not be responsible for driving home. 
	Further, self-driven cars would eliminate many jobs, like those who work for public authority, Uber, Lyft, or for taxi companies. This, in turn, could negatively affect our economy and leave many individuals without a means of income. Because car insurance would likely become extinct, insurance companies would also fail to thrive. Today, there is great need for individuals to work for transportation companies, as Uber and Lyft have become popularized by the convenience they provide. We should continue these services as they support those who perform the jobs as they remain an easy and convenient way to travel without driving yourself. 
	With eighty-one percent of car crashes being due to human error, the idea to use computers to operate cars appears to be a salient decision. As the article illuminates, there are “no opportunities for a computer to be ‘distracted’. Yet, computers, like humans, have the propensity to make mistakes. Although self-driving cars may be “more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers,” a self-driving car does not eliminate the likelihood of a car accident. There are many confounding variables to consider when thinking about individuals using self-driving cars: the weather, other traditional cars and their drivers, and the possibility of inappropriate - or developmentally-inappropriate persons - like children, mistakenly climbing behind the wheel. In these cases of an emergency, passengers of the self-driving car may be too overwhelmed or unable to respond in order to safely redirect the car. 
	In support of self-driven cars, however, is the way in which self-driving cars would support individuals with disabilities who rely on public transportation in order to travel. I believe this would be an accommodation that would make many destinations more accessible for those who could not drive themselves. Moreover, self-driven cars would be beneficial for the environment, as they would be electric and would not require gasoline to operate, which would, in turn would save users money as well. 
	Despite the innovative benefits of self-driving cars, I am wary of the notion of automatic cars and would not partake in purchasing one. To me, there is something very calming and enjoyable about driving, and I believe that many people feel the same way. To me, introducing self-driving cars has the potential to promote poor behavior, to remove the need for transportation services, and could be fickle depending on weather and circumstance. Ultimately, I believe that the responsibility of the individual is to make informed decisions when driving in order to protect themselves and others while on the road. We should not rely on others – or vehicles -- to make those decisions for us."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_57.txt,"Over the last decade, technology has rapidly found itself a part of nearly every aspect of daily life. It makes each day easier, simpler, and often safer, for all of society. Automation is the way of the future—an iPhone recommends apps to open, Ads show viewers what they ""want"" to buy before they even know what they want to buy, computer programs perform calculations in seconds that once took years. However, one area that has not yet seen a significant increase in digital automation is the aptly named automobile industry. While almost 150 years have passed since the birth of the automobile, for the most part, not much has changed. The two main components are still the vehicle and the all-important driver within. Soon however, that may change. 
	People get distracted. In many opinions, people are always distracted. But it’s often not before these people get behind the wheel of a vehicle capable of reaching speeds topping hundreds of miles per hour that this becomes an issue, leading to potential death and destruction on the roadways. Whenever people are involved, mistakes are inevitable. Self-Driving cars aim to solve this problem—putting the roadways firmly in the hands of advanced systems, safely and securely controlling and regulating travel with every turn of the wheel, push of the break, and touch of the pedal. But are we as a people willing to put our lives in the hand of an emotionless system? —A system carrying us at high speeds through the dangers of the outside world. For many people, the answer may quickly be becoming a resounding yes. 
	Technology has problems–phones crash, batteries die, software bugs can ruin an entire network, hackers can take control of computers from across the globe. While these flaws in devices can cause mayhem, they generally don’t result in the user dying. When you’re in the car but the car is doing the driving, not you, these “minor inconveniences” suddenly become life threatening. Nothing is perfect and paying possibly exorbitant amounts of money to be driven around by a potentially flawed machine could be a mistake, possibly the last one ever made. This way of thinking, however, is wrong. 
	Humanity takes chances every day in order to make their lives as easy as possible. It is the natural course of human evolution to strive for a better, simpler, easier world and way of doing things. Without risk there would be no progress. And, as mankind has progressed socially as well as technologically, the amount of risk afforded to each individual has decreased significantly even in the most extreme of circumstances.
        Every opportunity which helps save lives should be considered, and when said action also provides an easier method of progressing through the day, it is nigh-insane to not consider it. Much like the automation of phones, laptops, high-level financial systems, and much more, cars must, and will, one day become devoid of the control of their biggest flaw, drivers. The flaws of human drivers are a bug in the system of automation, a fixable one. No matter how hard it is tried, the future cannot be stopped and self driving cars are the future. 
	People make mistakes, machines don’t, unless they are programmed that way. And the only way to eliminate the mistakes of these programs is to allow them on the open road. Yes, flaws will be found, mistakes will happen, but with the caution shown by early adopters to self-driving cars, these mistakes will have safeties in place to prevent them from causing catastrophe. More importantly, the upside to a world of automated cars is huge. No more accidents, each car communicating with the other vehicles around it in ways unimaginable to the obliviousness of current drivers. This is the future, and like other tech before it, the only way to reach the future is to embrace it.","

Over the last decade, technology has revolutionized daily life, making each day easier, simpler, and safer for society. Automation is the way of the future, evident in personalized app recommendations, targeted advertisements, and rapid computer calculations. However, the automobile industry has been slow to adopt significant digital automation, with the vehicle-driver duo remaining largely unchanged since its inception. This is about to change.

**The Human Error Factor**
Distracted driving poses a significant threat to road safety, leading to potential fatalities and destruction. Human involvement inevitably leads to mistakes. Self-Driving cars aim to mitigate this issue by leveraging advanced systems to control and regulate travel. The question remains: are we willing to entrust our lives to an emotionless system? For many, the answer is increasingly affirmative.

**Addressing Technological Concerns**
While devices can malfunction (e.g., phone crashes, software bugs, and hacking), these flaws rarely result in fatalities. However, when applied to self-driving cars, such ""minor inconveniences"" become life-threatening. This concern, though, overlooks humanity's propensity for calculated risk-taking to simplify life. As we've progressed socially and technologically, individual risk has decreased, even in extreme circumstances.

**Embracing the Future**
Every opportunity to save lives should be considered, especially when it also streamlines daily life. Just as phones, laptops, and financial systems have been automated, cars will inevitably follow, eliminating the flaws of human drivers. While machines can be programmed to make mistakes, allowing them on the open road, with caution and safeguards, will ultimately refine their performance. The benefits of a world with automated cars are substantial: drastically reduced accidents, enhanced vehicle communication, and a significant leap towards a safer future. Embracing this technology is the only way to truly reach its potential. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_2.txt,"Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and democratizing commuting. On the other hand, the technology also raises a number of concerns, e.g. security, safety, and economy. 
	In my opinion, I support self-driving cars because the technology will have positive impacts on the society. First, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it eliminates deadly mistakes made by a human, such as driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tiredness). Moreover, drivers tend to have a false confidence over time, which will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Second, when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Consequently, we can save the cost of gas and our traveling time. Last but not least, self-driving cars democratize commuting and put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, they only operate on a pre-designated route and stop at particular locations (e.g. bus stops) rather than the travelers' desired destinations (e.g. a coffee shop on a small street) and schedules (e.g. after midnight). Furthermore, self-driving cars also provide private space for the travelers while in public transportations the travelers must share the space with many strangers. 
	Self-driving cars also have shortcomings but I think we can address them in a near future. These shortcomings can be categorized into two groups: the not-ready and the not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments of new challenges of the technology that our society has not addressed, e.g. legal responsibility and security. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? What would car-makers or software designers handle moral-sensitive situations? For example, which choice should be made by the self-driving car given an unavoidable accident killing either an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement? Security is another critical issue, such as how can drivers protect their personal data or even the self-driving cars if the vehicles are hacked? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. On the other hand, the not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology, e.g. human drivers' skills, different traffic regulations, interpreting police officers' signals, or the labor force. For example, there are concerns that drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuff. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. Another false opinion is the traffic regulation differences between states, e.g. turning right on red or not. In fact, cars can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on the GPS signal. They said that cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. However, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, police officers do not bother going down the streets to control the traffic. The officers just send information to the cars through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars and this will affect the labor force. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs to be manufactured. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more. These false assumptions will disappear when self-driving cars are deployed in the mass.
	In conclusion, I think self-driving car is a revolution, of which advantages will outweigh shortcomings, and brings positive impact to the society. I am excited to wait for the time that the technology will be complete and deployed to everyone.","
Self-driving cars have sparked intense debates recently, with both enthusiastic supporters and concerned critics. While acknowledging the technology's drawbacks, I firmly believe that its benefits will ultimately transform society for the better. 

**Enhanced Safety and Efficiency**: Self-driving cars minimize the risk of accidents caused by human errors, such as driving under the influence or fatigue. Moreover, as they communicate with each other, they can optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and saving commuters time and fuel costs. 

**Democratizing Mobility**: Self-driving cars provide unparalleled accessibility for people with difficulties traveling, including the elderly and those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which is limited by fixed routes and schedules, self-driving cars offer door-to-door service and private travel spaces.

**Addressing Shortcomings**: The challenges facing self-driving cars can be categorized into 'not-ready' and 'not-true' concerns. **Not-ready** challenges, including legal responsibility, security, and moral dilemma resolutions, must be proactively addressed through legislation, robust cybersecurity measures, and transparent ethical guidelines before mass deployment. **Not-true** assumptions, such as concerns over driver skill obsolescence, traffic regulation complexities, interpreting police signals, and labor force impacts, are misconceptions that will dissipate as the technology advances and integrates into society. For instance, cars can update their algorithms based on GPS locations to adhere to local traffic laws, and the shift to self-driving will likely create new manufacturing and service jobs.

**Conclusion**: In conclusion, the transformative potential of self-driving cars, including enhanced safety, increased efficiency, and democratized mobility, outweighs its challenges. With proactive addressing of the technology's shortcomings, I eagerly anticipate the positive societal impact of self-driving cars upon their widespread adoption. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_20.txt,"The potential benefits of self-driving cars mentioned in the Auto Insurance Center article, ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated with Self-Driving Cars,"" are significant: no need for a driving license, reduction of distracted driving, and more time for other activities while in the car. However, those benefits assume the car would be in control 100% of the time, which is not realistic. Operators need to be aware and prepared to take control in the event of an emergency. Without more conversation about the education that drivers would need to have to successfully operate self-driving cars and more research into privacy and safety, driver-less cars will not be as beneficial as some might think. 
	The article lists not needing to get a driving license as an advantage of self-driving cars, but that license is still necessary. Sources including Teletrac note that drivers would still have to be trained in how to properly operate the vehicle in self-driving mode. The article also makes the point that over-relying on technology could mean that drivers would no longer have the skills to override the system and manually control the vehicle in the event of a failure. Thus, self-driving cars actually require more education: both standard self-driving car operating procedures as well as regular driving training. A potential benefit mentioned in the article is that people who can't normally operate cars--those who are disabled, elderly, or intoxicated--could operate a self-driving car, but even if trained on how to properly operate a self-driving car, these individuals may not have the  capacity to manually drive the vehicle if a technological failure requires immediate human intervention. Concerning, the article says, ""when a computer takes over the driving responsibilities, drivers can use that time to [...] catch up on reading [...] without having to worry too much about road safety."" Not having to worry ""too much"" could put operators in a dangerous position should they need to take over should a system fail. Therefore, benefits--such as reduction of distracted driving and time in the car for other activities--have their limits, as drivers will need to be paying enough attention to take over in an emergency situation. 
	Even if operators were given the necessary education to enjoy those benefits to some degree, there remains 
a second major concern: safety and privacy. The articles mentions several features that would help with safety, such as reducing human error and determining appropriate stopping distances. However, it also mentions that hacking is a safety concern for many reporting sources, including the Guardian. In 2016, seemingly harmless Internet connected devices such as refrigerators were used to crash major websites such as Twitter and Amazon. If that large scale of an attack can happen with simple devices, there is obvious reason for concern about having a car connected to the Internet that could be remotely manipulated into driving dangerously. In addition to physical safety concerns, the car would have a plethora of personal data on the operators' movements. The article supports this by saying that people are ""concerned about the opportunity for a computer build into the self-driving car to collect personal data."" Personal safety and privacy are non-negotiable requirements of a successful self-driving car initiative.
	The technology to protect citizens' personal data and physical well-being has not caught up with the technology of the self-driving cars. Although self-driving cars have many benefits, alert, educated operators still have to be ready to take over in an emergency, negating those advantages.","

The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated with Self-Driving Cars"" by the Auto Insurance Center highlights significant potential benefits, including the elimination of driving licenses, reduction of distracted driving, and increased productivity during travel. However, these advantages rely on unrealistic assumptions of 100% autonomous control. In reality, operators must remain vigilant and prepared to intervene in emergencies. To fully harness the benefits of self-driving cars, there is a pressing need for in-depth discussions on operator education and rigorous research into privacy and safety concerns.

Contrary to the article's suggestion, a driving license may still be necessary, as emphasized by sources like Teletrac, which note that drivers require training to operate vehicles in self-driving mode effectively. Over-reliance on technology could erode drivers' ability to manually override the system in case of failure, indicating that self-driving cars actually demand more comprehensive education, encompassing both standard operating procedures and regular driving skills. While self-driving cars could empower individuals with disabilities, elderly, or intoxicated persons to operate vehicles, their capacity to intervene manually in technological failures remains a concern.

The article's point about utilizing travel time for other activities, assuming reduced worry about road safety, is misleading. Operators must remain attentive to take over in emergency situations, thus limiting the benefits of reduced distracted driving and increased leisure time in the vehicle.

Beyond the need for operator education, two critical concerns persist: safety and privacy. Although the article mentions safety features like reducing human error, the risk of hacking, as reported by sources like The Guardian, poses a significant threat. The 2016 large-scale attack on websites like Twitter and Amazon using internet-connected devices underscores the vulnerability of internet-linked vehicles to remote manipulation. Additionally, self-driving cars would accumulate extensive personal data on operators, raising non-negotiable concerns about physical and data security.

Currently, the technology safeguarding citizens' personal data and physical well-being lags behind the advancements in self-driving car technology. While self-driving cars offer numerous benefits, the necessity for alert, educated operators to be ready to intervene in emergencies undermines these advantages, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to their development and implementation. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_3.txt,"Self-driving cars, though only recently having become a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development, managing to thoroughly capture the public eye. A debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole has been raging onward with impassioned arguments on both sides. In this essay I aim to provide convincing evidence that, though they have potential to cause societal harm, given the distressing array of negative societal impacts associated with human-driven cars, the apparent feasibility for self-driving cars to ameliorate these issues makes it only rational to welcome their implementation. 
	To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these, it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. 
	While no one would rightly argue that our current system is ideal, skepticism toward self-driving cars at this stage is more than fair. The development of the vehicles is very much still in its developmental infancy. Coupling that fact with the reality of a mixed automotive environment - with both computerized and human driven cars - one might very well expect implementation of self-driving cars to cause an increase in accidents. The key question then becomes: ""would a self-driving car actually be any safer than a human-driven one?"". While there is currently insufficient information to give a definite answer, I think there are good reasons to put more faith in the self-driving cars. Whereas human drivers tend to fall into a lull of false confidence after driving for many years, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. Further, there is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. In the absence of such risks, a computerized car might very well behave safer even without the ability to intuitively grasp tendencies and perceptions of neighboring human drivers. 
	Others however, are more concerned about the societal impact of these cars than their safety specs. Even if the change means less lives lost on the road, it still may be an unwise one if it leads to the ruin of lives off the road. Given the number of transportation jobs, a computerized revolution could displace the occupations of many currently employed drivers. Furthermore, given the massive economic investment needed to own such a car, might this lead to a widening of already egregious inequality gaps in the country? 
	The transportation industry represents a real threat if we have no place for the newly unemployed to turn. This however, is not a problem unique to self-driving cars but rather, is a pervasive and imminent threat encroaching on us from all directions given the rapid advance of technological competency. If we cannot, as a society solve this more generally, the threats will be realized even in the absence of the driver-less car revolution; if we do find a way to support the displaced workers of other sectors I remain hopeful that such approaches can be implemented to the transportation-sector as well. 
	As for societal inequality, self-driving vehicles, if implemented properly, could actually be a great boon to economically struggling classes. To begin, the previously considered transportation industry automation, though bad for workers, could be fantastic for commodity prices. If the cost of all daily goods dropped, many would be the better for it. Further, current systems of public transportation are woefully insufficient to serve their desired societal role. When jobs, hospitals, and enrichment events are inconvenient to access, attendance from under serviced individuals tends to drop. This creates a de-facto restriction on who may access what. With an automated public transportation system, it could be much easier to introduce flexible pick-up locations, drop-off spots, and schedules. With a more functional and convenient public transportation system, we could relieve both the economic burden of buying a vehicle as well as the logistical burden of navigating tricky and time-consuming bus routes. 
	A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine whether those differences were successes or failures. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it is reasonable to maintain optimism about the ability of self-driving cars to bring about dramatic improvements to our lives.","

Self-driving cars have rapidly evolved since their inception, captivating the public's attention and sparking a heated debate about their suitability for our automotive environment and societal desirability. This essay aims to provide compelling evidence that, despite potential societal drawbacks, the feasibility of self-driving cars to mitigate the numerous negative impacts of human-driven cars makes their implementation a rational choice.

**The Fallibility of Human Drivers**
Human error, often due to fatigue, distraction, or negligence, contributes significantly to the estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents. This stark reality underscores the need for improvement. 

**Addressing Skepticism towards Self-Driving Cars**
While concerns about the developmental stage of self-driving cars and the risks of a mixed automotive environment are valid, there are reasons to trust their safety potential. Unlike human drivers, who may become complacent over time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve continuously. Moreover, they are immune to distractions, sleep deprivation, intoxication, and time pressures, which often compromise human driving. Although they may not intuitively grasp human drivers' tendencies, their risk-free operation could still make them safer.

**Societal Impact Concerns**
Others worry about the potential ruin of lives off the road, despite the lives saved on it. The displacement of transportation jobs and the potential widening of economic inequality gaps are legitimate concerns. However, these issues are not unique to self-driving cars but rather symptomatic of broader technological advancements. If we can develop support systems for workers displaced by technology in general, these can also be applied to the transportation sector.

**Mitigating Societal Inequality**
Properly implemented, self-driving vehicles could actually benefit economically struggling classes. Automation in the transportation industry, while detrimental to workers, could lead to decreased commodity prices, benefiting many. Furthermore, an automated public transportation system could offer flexible, convenient, and accessible services, relieving the economic and logistical burdens associated with vehicle ownership and navigating complex bus routes. This could effectively democratize access to jobs, healthcare, and enrichment opportunities.

**A Future with Self-Driving Cars**
A society embracing self-driving cars will undoubtedly look different. The success of this transformation hinges on the implementation strategy. While there are no guarantees, considering the shortcomings of our current system, it is reasonable to remain optimistic about the potential of self-driving cars to bring about significant improvements to our lives.

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_36.txt,"

I marvel at the ingenuity of scientists and engineers in developing self-driven vehicles. However, as someone who values independence, I have mixed feelings about their widespread adoption.

On one hand, self-driven cars could greatly benefit seniors and the disabled, providing them with unparalleled autonomy. Additionally, as electric vehicles, they could reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating environmental concerns.

On the other hand, I worry about the unintended consequences of relying on computers for everyday tasks like driving. While computers excel in analyzing large datasets, I fear we're losing essential skills, such as:

1. **Dynamic situational awareness**: The ability to navigate complex, shared spaces with other road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.
2. **Social interaction**: Public transportation facilitates chance encounters with diverse individuals, enriching our lives and fostering community.

Proponents argue that self-driven cars could replace public transportation, reducing infrastructure costs and promoting greener environments. However, this might:

1. **Exacerbate social atomization**: Further isolating individuals in their personal vehicles, undermining the social benefits of shared public spaces.
2. **Require comparable infrastructure**: Potentially offsetting any environmental gains, as a majority of the population would need to adopt autonomous vehicles.

Moreover, concerns remain regarding:

1. **Affordability**: Self-driven cars may become status symbols, widening the gap in our already divided society, at least in the short term.
2. **Safety**: The limitations of computer algorithms, vulnerability to cyber threats, and potential malfunctions raise concerns about passenger safety in unforeseen situations.
3. **Human agency**: The removal of control in critical situations, leaving individuals feeling helpless and passive, is a troubling prospect.

Imagine being in a self-driven car that cannot adapt to a sudden, unexpected event. The loss of human agency and collective problem-solving capacity is a worrying aspect of our increasing reliance on machines. I fear this could lead to a lifeless, passive existence, rather than fostering virtues like compassion and resilience that arise from human vulnerability. 

Ultimately, while self-driven cars offer benefits, I believe it's crucial to carefully weigh these against the potential risks to our social fabric, individual autonomy, and humanity. ","I marvel at the ingenuity of our scientists and engineers in bringing us self-driven vehicles. 
	Furthermore, I am a free spirit who cherishes her independence, including the freedom to go where she pleases when she pleases, without having to rely on other people, their schedules, their preferences and especially their notions about what I, as a woman of a certain age, should or should not be doing. All this makes me deeply empathetic toward seniors and the disabled who may not be able to drive, and for their sake, I can appreciate the value of a self-driven vehicle. 
	Moreover, since self-driven cars are likely to be electric, they could mean the end of our reliance on fossil fuels,  something doubtless to be desired by all of us who worry about the future of our polluted planet. 
	And yet, I find that something deeper, less rational, but nonetheless ineluctable, keeps me from endorsing self-driven cars, at least for the present. 
	We seem happy to cede increasing portions of our lives to computers. Where computers are absolutely better than us, e.g. in the analysis of large quantities of crucial data, say health-related  data, there can be no quarrel with their exclusive use. But I fear we may be in danger of losing too many of our everyday skills to them. Driving is a case in point. 
	You may ask what is so valuable about this skill. And I grant that for many, driving is routine, perhaps even tedious. Even so, there is a whole parcel of skills that are ancillary to driving per se. I mean the ability to be attentive and alert in a dynamic situation, the ability to be with others and jointly negotiate traffic so that all who use the streets, including cyclists and pedestrians, are safe and minimally inconvenienced. In our increasingly atomized world, these are not skills and capacities we can afford to lose. More is at stake than we might imagine. 
          Some claim that self-driven cars would obviate the need for public transportation, seeing this as something to recommend them. I disagree. Apart from the jobs lost, which I think most would see as a negative, there is the potential loss of public space, which after all, is what a bus, a subway car, or a train is. Like cities, where they are most in demand, forms of public transportation make for chance encounters with others whom we may otherwise never encounter. Cities, especially the larger ones, are rich in human variety, and one way to ensure that we limit our contact with this enriching variety is to sequester us in our individual self-driven vehicles. Sequestration of a sort is already far advanced. Most of us walk around mesmerized by screens and tuned in to our own individual soundscapes delivered via headphone. At home, this pattern of behavior continues, sadly. We are losing the ability to be with each other, whether that means having rich and complex and spontaneous interactions or simply occupying the same space, something that is not as mindless and mundane and trivial as it might appear, as psychologists and neuroscientists are beginning to understand. Self-driven cars, by eliminating the need for public transportation will only deepen this social atomization.
          The advocates of autonomous vehicles claim that eliminating public transportation cuts infrastructure costs, and they might even say, it would make for greener environs. But it is not clear whether the rise in the number of autonomous vehicles will not require comparable infrastructure, as the majority must drive such vehicles if they are to be a feasible option in the first place.
         And speaking of majorities, we are brought face to face with another problem: cost. It will surely be a while before self-driven cars are within the means of the majority. And assuming that they could become a viable proposition before the majority of the population owns them, they would in the interim be status symbols, affordable only by the wealthy.  Our already deeply divided society can do without such obvious markers of status differentials.
	And then, there is the question of safety. We all know that computer algorithms are not infallible, that programs can be infected with viruses, that hardware can malfunction, that computers are at the mercy of hackers. A human driver has a repertoire of skills to call upon in the event of unforeseen situations: an accident, bad weather, a terrorist attack. As far as I am aware, computer algorithms that function in very dynamic situations without human intervention are not that plentiful. What then would a rider do, especially if they are not tech savvy, in a complex and fluid situation? 
	You may argue that we are daily rendered helpless by such things as drunk or inattentive motorists, with dire consequences that are clear from the statistics about accidents. I cannot disagree. And yet, I find I must stand my ground. 
	I ask you to imagine a situation where your self-driving car cannot adapt in time, something as simple as a failure of traffic signals or a sudden thunderstorm, never mind a hacked program or a spectacular terrorist attack. Nor can the cars of anyone else. And you're all headed for disaster with no recourse. Rendered utterly passive where once you might have attempted some solution, no matter its efficacy. 
	It is this removal of human agency, individual and collective,  that I worry about. This helplessness that is not natural human vulnerability but rather thralldom to machines. Unlike human vulnerability, which can breed virtues like compassion and pity, this thralldom is not generative, it is lifeless in the way of an inorganic thing. 
	I do not wish to be thus reduced."
