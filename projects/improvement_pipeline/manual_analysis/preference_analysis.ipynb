However, omitting the prescription requirement for the morning-after pill also means forgoing pre-intake medical guidance. Given the pill's profound impact, particularly its abortive effect, dispensing it without medical counsel is inappropriate. Furthermore, unrestrained access might misleadingly position the morning-after pill as a preferable alternative to other, healthier contraceptive methods. This could lead to a decline in condom use, potentially resulting in an uptick in new AIDS infections and other sexually transmitted diseases, highlighting the need for informed medical advice to accompany access. </td>\n",

The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient, not to mention safer! Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road.

       "In my opinion, I support bringing self-driving cars into reality. The technology can bring many benefits to humanity. First, we, as human in modern societies, will save a lot of money thanks to the technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and they can communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Second, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it can eliminate mistakes made by a human. The most common mistake is driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tireness). Moreover, drivers tend to have false confidence as they have more driving hours. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Last but not least, self-driving cars put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, in many cases, they can only take a person to a pre-designated location (stop) rather than the real destination. Public transportations are operated with a fixed schedule which does not perfectly match everyone's situations. \n",
       "The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: not-ready and not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments about new challenges that the technology will bring in when it is deployed in mass. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? Or security issues such as how can drivers protect their personal data and what will happen if the car is hijacked by a hi-tech criminal? Interestingly, what would the car-makers or software designers choose in moral-sensitive situations? For example, given an unavoidable accident will happen, which will either kill an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement, which choice should be made by the self-driving car? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. The not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuffs. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. I use the washing machine at least twice a week without knowing how to make such a machine. Another false opinion is the difference between states regarding turning right on red or cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. In fact, the car can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. Moreover, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, the police officer does not need to go down the street and directs the traffic but just sends information to the car through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs a manufacturer. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.\n",

       "In my opinion, implementing self-driving cars is a step in the right direction. This technology can significantly benefit humanity in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to substantial cost savings for individuals in modern societies. With the ability of self-driving cars to communicate, they can mitigate congestion and navigate through unknown traffic conditions more effectively. Secondly, by eliminating human error—the primary cause of accidents, including those due to driving under the influence or fatigue—self-driving cars enhance road safety. Additionally, the confidence that comes with experience, which can paradoxically increase the risk of accidents, is also averted. Lastly, self-driving cars provide equitable mobility for individuals with travel difficulties, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which often has fixed routes and schedules that may not cater to everyone's needs, self-driving cars can offer door-to-door service.\n",

Implementation challenges include unanswered questions about responsibility in the event of an accident, data security, potential hijacking, and moral dilemmas in unavoidable accidents. These issues must be addressed before mass deployment. Misconceptions, on the other hand, include the assumption that drivers will lose operational skills (similar to how we use daily appliances without fully understanding their mechanics), concerns about adapting to state-specific traffic laws (easily resolved through GPS-based algorithm updates), and fears about reduced car sales for manufacturers (which is unlikely as self-driving cars still require manufacturing, as evidenced by the growing number of car manufacturers, including Volvo, BMW, Toyota, and Honda, entering the self-driving market).\n",

       "Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize transportation by significantly decreasing accidents and mitigating the environmental impact of the gasoline industry, which has become a substantial pollutant. Unlike humans, who are prone to distractions, the computer operating the vehicle remains focused. Notably, the average human attention span of just eight seconds can lead to delayed reactions to unexpected obstacles, such as deer or bicyclists. Human error, responsible for approximately 94% of traffic accidents, is largely attributed to distracted, drunk, or reckless driving.\n",
       "\n",
       "The adoption of self-driving cars is expected to drastically reduce accidents, particularly those caused by distracted driving. Common distractions like using cell phones, eating, conversing with passengers, or adjusting the radio can be eliminated. Additionally, self-driving cars will likely prevent accidents resulting from speeding, drunk driving, ignoring traffic signals, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, self-driving cars will probably operate on electric power, offering numerous environmental benefits. Electric vehicles (EVs) are more efficient, producing significantly less pollution. They provide a smoother, quieter ride compared to traditional gas-operated cars, which are becoming outdated. The cost advantages of EVs are substantial, with operating costs estimated to be one-third to one-quarter of those for gasoline-powered vehicles. Maintenance is also reduced, as EVs do not require oil changes, and the absence of tailpipes improves air quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gasoline industry's detrimental effects on air quality, including the emission of carcinogenic chemicals like benzene, can be mitigated by transitioning to electric cars. The inhalation of gasoline fumes can lead to various health issues, and the reliance on dwindling fossil fuels is unsustainable. \n",
       "\n",
       "While this shift may necessitate the retraining of mechanics from gas garages to work on electric vehicles or adapt to new roles, history has shown that technological progress often requires workforce adjustments. The transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles serves as a precedent, where the focus was on embracing innovation rather than preserving outdated industries. Furthermore, public transportation services, such as buses and taxis, will continue to operate, ensuring employment opportunities for drivers.</td>\n",

However, self-driving cars, which significantly reduce driving effort, may be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Growing up in the Himalayan foothills, where infrastructure is limited and roads are treacherous, highlighted the challenges of driving in remote areas. The success of self-driving cars, largely tested in the infrastructure-rich United States, may not be universally applicable. The reliance on accurate GPS mapping, which is not globally available and is susceptible to weather conditions, poses a significant concern.\n",

In recent time, we have also seen improvement in road infrastructure and that has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane job which we need to do compute on daily basis. Such technology can help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for whom this more like a job than a passion or a choice. Though I strongly advocate the research in this area, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles.\n",

Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are a symbol of personal freedom. The United States as per my understanding cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars. The success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.\n",
       "Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in the middle age and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into the more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program. \n",

The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. \n",

Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.\n",

The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible: safer driving via decreased accidents, the inability for a computer to get distracted, identifying traffic problems and no longer needing a designated driver, saving money, and saving time. On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening as they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered and jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer.

Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road.

       "We are happy and lucky to be seeing the history of the way that how people are transported changes. The most recent one that is taking place quietly is brought by self-driving cars, which as the name indicates, can drive itself without the operation of human. Sometimes they are called \"driver-less cars\" too. Indeed, the reality is that self-driving cars aren't that far off. Right now, the residents from Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, California and Pennsylvania are fortunate enough to have already seen some tested self-driving cars are running merrily down the streets, wearing lots of cameras which make them look strange but cute.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alongside the technology of self-driving cars that has emerged during this time while not yet realized, the debate on the pros vs. cons of self-driving cars has already started to rage on. Whether it is a gift of God, or just another devil coming out from Pandora's Box? People hold different ideas. But are self-driving cars really that controversial? If they are, then why hundreds of huge companies, including Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, Tencent, are now researching dramatically on self-driving cars? Are they crazy? Are they wasting their money on these \"terrible\" products? \n",

       "The answers can't be too obvious. Self-driving ARE the most beautiful gifts endowed by our God.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are uncountable benefits of self-driving cars. Among them there are two prominent ones. The first regards the driving safety. While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: \"They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers.\" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, which uses delicately designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically. \n",
       "\n",
       "The second advantage is that self-driving cars can benefit not only many normal people, but those who desperately need help as well. For example they will give more freedom and enhanced mobility to people who are not suited to driving, such as the handicapped, the drunk or the senior citizens. With self-driving cars, their rely on public transportation or\n",
       "assistance from others to get around would become minimal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Well, up till now those people who are pessimistic about self-driving cars may barely argue the their benefits, but they are overly concerning with some potential factors. Here we would list out two of the most controversial issues which, however, are not problems at all, in our opinion. \n",
       "\n",
       "Firstly of all, some individuals are concerned about the opportunity for a computer built into the self-driving car to collect personal data. Indeed, we have that risk. However, in the future with the development computers and AI, every device or item in our life will get electronic-wised and the information of every thing's information, a human or physical item, will flow through the internet of things (IOT), in order to make our life more intelligent. Self-driving cars is only a small portion of it the the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second, people argue \"self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers.\" This could have a negative impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. However, this effect is short-term, for the sake of long term advancement of human history. In other words, if we forbid the development of self-driving cars because of this short-term interest, then people will improve on transportation in a long term.\n",

       "Embracing self-driving cars, with a focus on long-term development, could revolutionize daily life by significantly enhancing road safety, reducing costs, increasing personal time, and boosting overall societal well-being.

       "      <td id=\"T_a6208_row10_col3\" class=\"data row10 col3\" >The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets since the public sphere became aware of the role these futuristic vehicles could play in the not-to-distant future. First, there are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advanced machinery could have on modern life. These potential issues include the sheer cost of the software, the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car, as well as the security risks of the software itself. The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits. For instance, in California, people purchasing new electric vehicles can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500 depending on the size of the car's battery, and we could see a similar incentive allotted to self-driving cars in the future as their software has the potential to greatly decrease car insurance costs. Other skeptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where traffic signals have failed and police move to the intersection to direct traffic. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch that would allow a driver to take control of the wheel for a period of time so the driver may avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. The potential for the software to be targeted by hackers is another real issue that could become a major problem if the software isn't adequately protected. However, as long as information identifying the owner of each vehicle is kept separate from the car's computer software and the software that controls the cars is linked to a kill switch that could safely pull the car off the road and alert the driver, any substantial damage associated with this threat could be minimized even though the potential to completely protect from it is limited. There are, however, many advantages that I believe outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation within the car, or events happening outside, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be less responsible for people to purchase car insurance and manufacturers who are making vast amounts of money from car sales could cover the cost of the insurance, which would provide consumers with more money to use in the market. Lastly, the potential of platooning and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to due to their inability to operate a vehicle. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives, as long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution.</td>\n",

The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that though it is not perfect, the prospect of driver-less roads would mark a definitive improvement over our current conditions. \n",
       "\n",
       "To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. Although it is not yet certain that self-driving cars in their current condition would cause that number to go down, the lack of human fallibility makes the prospect seem likely. Furthermore, whereas human driver tend to fall into a lull of false confidence when they have engaged in a task for an extended period of time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. There is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. \n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, self-driving cars could give society a method of transportation which is much less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are limited to those capable of operating the machinery, passing their test, and -for the most part - affording to own their own vehicle. If a child needs to be transported to any sort of extracurricular event they are bound by their parents' schedules and mobilities. If a senior citizen who has been deemed unsafe to drive decides to go shopping they must wait for long periods to use public transportation with conditions that could be extremely painful or uncomfortable with those who experience chronic pain from arthritis or similar conditions. Furthermore, many who cannot afford their own car are forced to commute long distances to their jobs, health-care, and programs, forcing a de facto restriction on who may access what. Although it is likely that one who cannot afford a regular car could not afford their own self-driving car, there is nothing to say that they must have their own. The ability to have a car drive back to the place it left from could allow a much more intricate form of car sharing; additionally, the current restrictions on insured drivers that hassle any type of shared vehicle would likely be thoroughly relaxed or missing entirely for a driver-less car. Even beyond the prospect of shared cars, self-driving vehicles could revolutionize public transportation, making a wider range of pick up locations and drop off locations feasible. If large buses or a huge fleet of public cars were to have flexible routes that could give people who do not have the means to own their own car a transportational freedom akin to it at a fraction of the price that services like Uber and Lift offer today. \n",

While it is uncertain whether current self-driving cars would immediately reduce this number, their inherent lack of human fallibility makes a decrease likely.

This limits the mobility of children, senior citizens, and those with chronic conditions, forcing them to rely on others or endure uncomfortable public transportation. The shared mobility potential of self-driving cars—facilitated by their ability to return to a starting point without a driver—could provide a more intricate and accessible car-sharing system, unencumbered by traditional insurance restrictions. Moreover, integrating self-driving vehicles into public transportation could make a broader range of pickup and drop-off locations feasible, offering transportational freedom to those without means, at a fraction of the cost of current ride-sharing services.\n",

Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. Self-driving cars would also be cheaper for the government by saving money that would have been spent on transit projects such as building trains. Lastly, self-driving cars would be time saving for both passengers and police officers. Passengers who would now be allowed to rest or perform work on their commute to their destination, and police officers would be able to spend less time catching speeding vehicles on the highway and more time solving more serious crimes. \n",

For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class and rich would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. In addition, like with any technology created this 21st century there are risks for serious and even fatal malfunctions. Although not common, everyday electronics such as iPhones and laptops, concepts deemed impossible a century ago, do in fact experience problems and have stopped working for its users. While iPhones and laptops are nowhere as complex as self-driving cars, the fact of the matter is the electronic advancements made these past decades have been remarkable, but if these items have showed us anything it is that nothing is ever perfect and some software or hardware problem could always occur at any moment and without notice. It would be difficult to program self-driving cars to distinguish between new traffic laws or recent road work that occurred overnight. Also, it would be dangerous if hackers would be able to hijack vehicles and purposely take control of these self-driving vehicles. \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives. A human life is the only thing on earth that can't be bought no matter how much money an individual has. Death does not discriminate based on age, gender, sex, religion, race, or social status. Car accidents do occur and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident.</td>\n",

As we have imagined since decades ago, technologies are now being tested for cars for the purpose of creating safer self-driving cars with the use of sophisticated algorithms. However, as relying on the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use.

One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact, fine-grained cause when an accident occurs due to a human error.

Additional benefits cited include the potential for coordinated speed management and traffic light synchronization among multiple cars, leading to enhanced flow and reduced travel times. With their precision, self-driving cars could also increase road capacity while decreasing congestion. Moreover, they would provide invaluable mobility for the disabled and elderly. As their adoption grows, society could reap numerous rewards: saved lives, avoided financial losses, decreased fuel consumption, and a reduced need for traffic police.\n",

       "Detractors, however, raise several legitimate concerns. While some superficial worries (e.g., a car breakdown leading to citywide chaos due to forgotten driving skills) are easily refutable – given that most individuals already lack the skills to handle a stranded vehicle – others question the technology's limitations. Concerns about performance in snowy or potholed conditions, though valid, are not insurmountable, as the technology is rapidly advancing to address such challenges.\n",

Nevertheless, something on the horizon is going to turn everything about cars upside down (well, the cars themselves will probably still remain on their four wheels, though!)\n",

       "Self-driving cars are already among us fueling the debate over their good and and evil. Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the catastrophic number of fatal car crashes because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, the opponents of the technology have some legitimate concerns. In this category there are some superficial and trivial arguments that can be refuted right away. For example, the phobia of a scenario where a car breaks down and the human driver, having forgotten how to drive, has no idea of what to do, leading to chaos in the city cannot be a real argument against self-driving cars. Already today, an average individual has no skill to get a car to start up if it all of a sudden stops in the middle of street. Such a situation rarely disrupts a whole city! Some other arguments question the limits of the technology. What if it snows? What if the road is full of potholes (such as those in Pittsburgh!)? Well, these while valid concerns do not prove the technology insufficient. There are improvements coming every day and all those conditions will be taken care of.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the obvious criticism of the self-driving cars out of way, we arrive at some deep issues against the technology. On the infrastructure level, there is the problem of providing cyber security to such a delicate network of interconnected software that store and communicate data between cars. If, as Guardian suggests, there is a potential for hackers to manipulate such a system, then it will be a true disaster. Achieving a high level of security while possible could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the biggest challenge facing self-driving cars is their popularity. The pros listed above all are predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Have you noticed that sometimes, ironically, the safest drivers, are the very cause of some accidents? Imagine a road where the speed limit is 50, but \"everyone knows that it is ok to go 60 (when the police is not around!)\". Then that one guy who sticks to that 50 mph limit is the source of frustration for those behind him/her and a possible danger for everyone involved. Thus, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.\n",

This is achieved through continuously aware sensors, which are less prone to distractions than human drivers. Consequently, this leads to decreased traffic congestion while allowing a greater number of vehicles on the road.\n",

I argue that the use of eco-friendly materials and efficient technologies has a positive ripple effect: cleaner air, a healthier environment, and ultimately, a healthier population. For instance, reducing traffic congestion with electric self-driving cars decreases the time spent on the road, which in turn minimizes waste emissions and purifies the air, contributing to a healthier environment for its inhabitants.\n",

This thereby reduces traffic while still increasing the number of cars that can be on the road. The most important disadvantage I find is that for self driving cars, the electric nature of the self-driving cars may reduce the net profit of gasoline industries. This is to say, that in becoming \"new and improved\" manufacturers may stray away from using gas as fuel and move towards using electricity as fuel because this type of fuel is more environmentally friendly.\n",

       "It is the exact theme of being environmentally friendly by being efficient that makes me argue that self-driving cars are beneficial to society. I wish to argue that materials that make the air healthier, make the environment healthier, and then make the people who live in the environment healthier. The example allowing more cars to be on the road would make the air healthier especially if the cars were electric because the reference paper argues that this would reduce traffic and so the cars would be on the road for less time. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that less waste emitted from the energy used. This renders the air healthier and the people in this environment healthier. \n",
       "Finally, I wish to argue that the electric nature of the cars would make the environment healthier because gasoline powered cars make the environment less clean. In my experiences abroad I often saw trucks emitting black gas clouds to the point that the vision of the driver behind was impaired. When I visit the gas station, the smell of gasoline is never ignored. I do not mind the smell, but I know it is not healthy to inhale for a long time. Also, the threat of gasoline ignition is not one to ignore. I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while trying to refuel my vehicle and if there was a fire nearby this could have become more than a \"small, careless\"  mistake. All in all when changes can be made for prevention of dangerous incidents and development of diseases, then these changes move society to a healthier life style. \n",

However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry. \n",

       "When weighing the \"pros\" and \"cons\" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The \"pros\" are all valid, while it appears that many of the \"cons\" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the \"cons\" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles.\n",

Therefore I recommend the gradual adoption of self-driving vehicles into society.</td>\n",

Ideally designed autonomous vehicles can surpass human driving safety standards due to their singular focus, unencumbered by human distractions, intoxication, or diversion. Additionally, self-driving cars can optimize traffic patterns through coordinated vehicle communication, maintaining safe distances and sharing road condition updates, potentially eradicating rush hour congestion.

The technology is exciting, highlighting our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but the application of it in our day to day lives presents many important questions that first need answering.\n",
       "     Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will be able to have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because computers have one thing to focus on. They don't worried about the kids, their date, or their finances like humans do, nor can they get drunk or distracted. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more, which would all add together into a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might cease to exist! Insurance and healthcare costs would decrease with less accidents as well, and these companies might even be forced to establish a new business model. \n",
       "     However, there is always more than one side to an argument. There are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. \"Trolley problems\", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology that can be hacked and have some of their functions remotely controlled. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved.

One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars.

With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime.\n",
       "            The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked.

Along with all major technological advancements that have occurred in the twenty-first century there are major pros and major cons to this advancement.\n",
       " In general, many of the pros center preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.\n",
       "There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. additionally, many people rely on providing transportation as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may effect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident?\n",
       "With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out the human errors are extremely important. With more and more cars being on the roads today, there is a higher and higher chance to be in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, I feel, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back.To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful. Overall, I believe that these benefits greatly outweigh the costs.</td>\n",

       "As we accelerate towards a future dominated by self-driving cars, it's essential to weigh the significant advantages and disadvantages of this technological leap. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Preventive Benefits:**\n",
       "The primary advantages of self-driving cars lie in their potential to mitigate damage. By minimizing human error—a leading cause of crashes—the integrated computer system significantly reduces the risk of accidents. This includes averting disasters caused by distracted driving, such as drunk driving and texting while driving. Consequently, self-driving cars are poised to save numerous lives. Additional benefits include reduced costs, such as lower insurance premiums and the elimination of driver's education expenses. Furthermore, the liberation from driving duties allows individuals to optimize their time, utilizing it for other activities. Enhanced speed limits and adaptive navigation through road obstructions will also expedite travel times.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Potential Drawbacks:**\n",
       "However, several concerns predominantly affect the lower socioeconomic class. The high cost of self-driving cars may render them inaccessible to many Americans. Moreover, individuals reliant on driving as a source of income may face financial instability. The fallibility of machines also poses risks, including software hacking, detection issues, and weather interference with detection systems. A critical question arises in the event of an incident: who bears responsibility?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Personal Stance:**\n",
       "After considering both sides, I firmly believe that the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks. Acknowledging my privileged position, which may enable me to afford such a vehicle (particularly with reduced insurance costs), I emphasize the paramount importance of eliminating human error. As the number of vehicles on the road increases, so does the risk of accidents caused by human mistake. Eradicating this risk would be a monumental achievement. Additionally, the potential to reclaim time currently spent driving is invaluable. As the adage goes, \"time is the one thing you can never get back.\" The ability to reduce travel time and utilize previously spent driving time productively is extremely beneficial. Ultimately, I conclude that these advantages significantly outweigh the associated costs. </td>\n",

      "Have you ever been trapped in an unnecessary traffic slowdown? Have you thought about how much time and gas you could save if the roadways and cars operated more efficiently and safely? Have you ever been concerned about public safety because of dangerous drivers who may be distracted, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise impaired? All of these problems could be solved with self-driving cars. The widespread use of self-driving cars could improve efficiency and safety of roadways, free up time and resources for members of society, and eliminate the human error that results in needless car accidents each year.\n",

When self-driving cars communicate and work together on the road, they are able to improve traffic conditions and congestion. They are also able to identify road risks early on to avoid further frustration during your ride. The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient, not to mention safer! Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road. Though this is a legitimate concern, it should be tempered with the knowledge that methods for hacking prevention are on the rise since this is a concern in all technological aspects of our lives like our personal computers and cell phones.\n",

Not only would it create time directly through commute reduction, but it would also potentially allow drivers to spend time in the car doing other things like reading or talking with other passengers, since their attention may not need to be on the road. It could be argued that drivers will still need to maintain focus while riding in self-driving cars. This may be true initially, but as the technology improves and becomes more widespread, passive driving will become a reality. Reduced costs associated with gasoline are just an added benefit for society!\n",

      "Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and give opportunities to many people who can't travel by themselves at this moment. On the other hand, people also raise concerns about the security, safety, and economy of the technology.\n",
      "In my opinion, I support bringing self-driving cars into reality. The technology can bring many benefits to humanity. First, we, as human in modern societies, will save a lot of money thanks to the technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and they can communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Second, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it can eliminate mistakes made by a human. The most common mistake is driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tireness). Moreover, drivers tend to have false confidence as they have more driving hours. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Last but not least, self-driving cars put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, in many cases, they can only take a person to a pre-designated location (stop) rather than the real destination. Public transportations are operated with a fixed schedule which does not perfectly match everyone's situations. \n",
      "The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: not-ready and not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments about new challenges that the technology will bring in when it is deployed in mass. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? Or security issues such as how can drivers protect their personal data and what will happen if the car is hijacked by a hi-tech criminal? Interestingly, what would the car-makers or software designers choose in moral-sensitive situations? For example, given an unavoidable accident will happen, which will either kill an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement, which choice should be made by the self-driving car? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. The not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuffs. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. I use the washing machine at least twice a week without knowing how to make such a machine. Another false opinion is the difference between states regarding turning right on red or cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. In fact, the car can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. Moreover, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, the police officer does not need to go down the street and directs the traffic but just sends information to the car through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs a manufacturer. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.\n",

On the other hand, concerns about security, safety, and economic impact are also raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, implementing self-driving cars is a step in the right direction. This technology can significantly benefit humanity in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to substantial cost savings for individuals in modern societies. With the ability of self-driving cars to communicate, they can mitigate congestion and navigate through unknown traffic conditions more effectively. Secondly, by eliminating human error—the primary cause of accidents, including those due to driving under the influence or fatigue—self-driving cars enhance road safety. Additionally, the confidence that comes with experience, which can paradoxically increase the risk of accidents, is also averted. Lastly, self-driving cars provide equitable mobility for individuals with travel difficulties, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which often has fixed routes and schedules that may not cater to everyone's needs, self-driving cars can offer door-to-door service.\n",

      "Concerns about self-driving cars can be categorized into 'implementation challenges' and 'misconceptions'. Implementation challenges include unanswered questions about responsibility in the event of an accident, data security, potential hijacking, and moral dilemmas in unavoidable accidents. These issues must be addressed before mass deployment. Misconceptions, on the other hand, include the assumption that drivers will lose operational skills (similar to how we use daily appliances without fully understanding their mechanics), concerns about adapting to state-specific traffic laws (easily resolved through GPS-based algorithm updates), and fears about reduced car sales for manufacturers (which is unlikely as self-driving cars still require manufacturing, as evidenced by the growing number of car manufacturers, including Volvo, BMW, Toyota, and Honda, entering the self-driving market).\n",

The computer running the car won’t be distracted like humans. The average attention span is only eight seconds so a person might not respond fast enough to a deer in the headlights or a bicyclist going past. Human error causes 94% of traffic accidents. Most traffic accidents are caused by drunk and distracted driving.\n",
      "     A self-driving car will prevent many accidents especially ones caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk or text on their cell phones, eat and drink, talk to people in their vehicle, or play with the radio/CD player while driving which is highly dangerous. Children, pets, conversations, and preoccupations such as applying makeup can distract a driver.\n",

An electric car is very quiet and very smooth compared to gas operated cars which are clunky and outdated. Electric cars are cheaper to operate so have a big cost advantage over gas. Electric cars are also more efficient so cost about one-third to one-quarter the cost of gasoline. Maintenance costs are less since electric cars don’t need oil changes. Since electric cars don’t have a tailpipe they will improve the air quality.\n",
      "     Gas cars pollute the atmosphere so it’s time we eliminate or lessen the gasoline industry so we can breathe healthier air. High levels of chemicals taken in from gasoline exposure like benzene may cause cancer. The inhalation of fumes can lead to confusion, dizziness, headaches and breathing difficulties. Using gasoline is bad since it relies on fossil fuels which are in short supply and dwindling. Therefore it’s time we switched to electric cars.\n",
      "     The mechanics in gas garages can be trained to work on electric cars instead or for other jobs. When we switched from the horse and buggy to cars we didn’t worry about the people who raised horses losing jobs. We can’t let that stop inevitable progress. People who don’t own cars will still ride the buses and take taxis so those operating the vehicles will still have jobs.\n",

      "Embracing Self-Driving Cars and Reducing Reliance on the Gasoline Industry\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize transportation by significantly decreasing accidents and mitigating the environmental impact of the gasoline industry, which has become a substantial pollutant. Unlike humans, who are prone to distractions, the computer operating the vehicle remains focused. Notably, the average human attention span of just eight seconds can lead to delayed reactions to unexpected obstacles, such as deer or bicyclists. Human error, responsible for approximately 94% of traffic accidents, is largely attributed to distracted, drunk, or reckless driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adoption of self-driving cars is expected to drastically reduce accidents, particularly those caused by distracted driving. Common distractions like using cell phones, eating, conversing with passengers, or adjusting the radio can be eliminated. Additionally, self-driving cars will likely prevent accidents resulting from speeding, drunk driving, ignoring traffic signals, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, self-driving cars will probably operate on electric power, offering numerous environmental benefits. Electric vehicles (EVs) are more efficient, producing significantly less pollution. They provide a smoother, quieter ride compared to traditional gas-operated cars, which are becoming outdated. The cost advantages of EVs are substantial, with operating costs estimated to be one-third to one-quarter of those for gasoline-powered vehicles. Maintenance is also reduced, as EVs do not require oil changes, and the absence of tailpipes improves air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gasoline industry's detrimental effects on air quality, including the emission of carcinogenic chemicals like benzene, can be mitigated by transitioning to electric cars. The inhalation of gasoline fumes can lead to various health issues, and the reliance on dwindling fossil fuels is unsustainable. \n",
      "\n",
      "While this shift may necessitate the retraining of mechanics from gas garages to work on electric vehicles or adapt to new roles, history has shown that technological progress often requires workforce adjustments. The transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles serves as a precedent, where the focus was on embracing innovation rather than preserving outdated industries. Furthermore, public transportation services, such as buses and taxis, will continue to operate, ensuring employment opportunities for drivers.\n",

      "Imagine a night out with friends from junior high, ending with you exhausted, lost, and in no condition to drive. A self-driving car can ensure a safe journey home. While this technology is relatively new and debated, it's crucial to address concerns about its reliability in complex road situations and interactions with other drivers or authorities. Despite these uncertainties, self-driving cars hold significant promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Addressing Algorithmic Doubts**\n",
      "Although road situations can be unpredictable, many can be generalized. For instance, if a sensor detects an obstacle, whether a cat or a person, the vehicle will stop. This principle also applies to interactions with other drivers. Moreover, if learning to drive is challenging for many, instructing a self-driving car should be more straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages Over Human Drivers**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Reduced Distractions:** Unlike humans, who are often distracted (with many accidents being preventable and caused by such distractions), computers remain focused. This accuracy surpasses human capabilities, especially in scenarios where drivers might be under the influence, emotionally affected, or preoccupied with passengers.\n",
      "* **Increased Productivity:** With AI handling driving, individuals can devote more time to their careers, enhancing personal and societal benefits.\n",

      "**Empowering the Physically Limited**\n",
      "Self-driving cars can revolutionize transportation for those with physical limitations, who currently rely heavily on public transport or family members. This is particularly crucial in an aging population. For example, the time spent driving family members could be significantly reduced, offering greater independence and flexibility for all parties involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Optimizing Routes for Efficiency and Sustainability**\n",
      "AI can calculate the most efficient routes using advanced algorithms (like minimal spanning tree), which most drivers wouldn't apply manually. This not only saves time on the road but also reduces gasoline consumption, contributing to environmental protection. \n",

      "3. am in the morning after drinking with your best friends at junior high, you are exhausted, lost, and drunk in the middle of nowhere. You want to drive back home but that is just too dangerous. A self-driving car can take you home safely. This is a rather new area and quite debatable. How can we make sure that robots will solve all the complicated situation on the roads? What if there are other humans involved, such as other drivers or police giving signals? Most importantly, how can we use it? Indeed, there are many uncertainties related to self-driving cars but overall it is a promising topic. Self-driving cars can avoid distractions, help elder and disabled people to drive car and save energy and time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, let us address the doubt of the self-driving algorithm. Even though the situation on the road is unpredictable, many situations can be highly generalized. For example, if the sensor noticed something in the front, regardless of whether it is a furry cat or grumpy grandpa, it will stop at once. The same principal applies to other human drivers around. Moreover, learning to drive itself is difficult for many people. Learning how to tell a robot to drive should not be harder than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human drivers can be easily distracted. “Many of [traffic] accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving.” However, it is much harder to get a computer lost in the beautiful view along the road. In this case, AI is much more accurate than human. Human drivers maybe drunk or affected by drugs. They may also be affected by their mood, from depression to ecstasy. They may also busy with talking to their passengers. If Al is in charge, human can spend less time in driving and more time in focusing their own career, which is beneficial for them as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, many people rely heavily on public transportation or other people in their family in order to travel. This is because they cannot drive on their own due to physical limitation. However, not everyone has time to pick them up. Especially when we are entering the era that more and more elder people are around. I was forced to wait for my grandmother and drive her to her home in the childhood. This not only spend much time of mine which I could have spent in other places, but also my grandmother can only travel once every week because my father is too busy to drive her one more time. Just imagine how much benefit self-driving car will bring to us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, AI can calculate the best route. In our class, we learn about minimal spending tree and many other algorithms to find the shortest route. However, not many people will apply graph theory before they drive. Therefore, using a self-driver can make sure that they find the best possible way to go to school or company. This will save the amount of time they spend on the road and save gasoline as well. This will protect our environment too.\n",

      "The 21st century has witnessed unprecedented growth in technology and automation, transforming numerous tasks. Driving, once a prized skill, can now be considered mundane for many. Recent advancements in road infrastructure have simplified the driving experience. Self-Driving cars could potentially eliminate this daily chore, particularly benefiting taxi drivers for whom driving is a necessity rather than a passion. While I strongly support continued research in this area, I have reservations about the widespread implementation of self-driving vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many millennials, driving is a long-held practice, facilitated by the global economy and more affordable vehicles. However, self-driving cars, which significantly reduce driving effort, may be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Growing up in the Himalayan foothills, where infrastructure is limited and roads are treacherous, highlighted the challenges of driving in remote areas. The success of self-driving cars, largely tested in the infrastructure-rich United States, may not be universally applicable. The reliance on accurate GPS mapping, which is not globally available and is susceptible to weather conditions, poses a significant concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the technology's dependence on machine learning algorithms, which are not yet 100% accurate, raises concerns about potential mishaps. Another hurdle is the need for humans capable of operating sophisticated technology, as many, especially in middle and old age, are hesitant to fully utilize technology, potentially leading to malfunctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even setting aside these concerns, the large-scale implementation costs are substantial and financially questionable. The expenses for implementation and perfecting road infrastructure outweigh the anticipated benefits. The reduction in accidents, a key advantage of self-driving cars, has been somewhat disputed, with instances of self-driving cars being involved in accidents, highlighting that they do not entirely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction can lead to severe issues, potentially exacerbated by the human operator's lack of manual control, especially in high-concentration driving environments like the Himalayan roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In conclusion**, while self-driving vehicles are an intriguing concept, their implementation is hindered by multiple constraints, including civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, and financial costs.

Humans have found a way to automate every possible task using the availability of high computing power and highly sophisticated algorithms. Driving has been a passion for some and mundane task for others but it has been an important skill for some time now. In recent time, we have also seen improvement in road infrastructure and that has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane job which we need to do compute on daily basis. Such technology can help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for whom this more like a job than a passion or a choice. Though I strongly advocate the research in this area, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles.\n",
      "Most of us millennials like me started driving at an early age, growing worldwide economy can cheaper cars have helped the gap and luxury to drive a car in recent time. Self-driving cars which can drastically reduce the effort required in driving can be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure and road. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are a symbol of personal freedom. The United States as per my understanding cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars. The success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.\n",
      "Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in the middle age and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into the more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program. \n",
      "Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can lead to major issues and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator to understand the issue and can lead to major accidents within seconds due to lack of manual control. Himalayan roads where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of any malfunction.\n",
      "In conclusion, self-driving vehicles is a great idea but are limited to multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs.

Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. \n",
      "\n",
      "While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.\n",

      "Self-driving cars also have the potential to save lives. They rectify the lingering issue of drunk or drug-influenced drivers who should not be operating normal motor vehicles. These advanced cars would also decrease distracted drivers or tired drivers on the road. This article cites the CDC and points out that “fatalities from traffic accidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people.” All of the impaired drivers mentioned previously contribute to this statistic. But when unsafe drivers are taken out of the driver’s seat, the overall safety of people everywhere increases.\n",

As with all breakthroughs, the deployment of self-driving cars sparks debate about their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Auto Insurance Center's article, “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars,” there are numerous points of contention on both sides. The primary argument in favor of self-driving cars is their potential to drastically reduce human-related driving errors, thereby increasing transportation efficiency. With the burden of speed management and situational awareness lifted, drivers can enjoy unparalleled freedom, whether they have a disability or are temporarily incapacitated. This could notably enhance the overall quality of life for users of self-driving transportation. Notably, many drivers have already adapted to preliminary self-driving features like autonomous braking, self-parking, and obstacle detection sensors. Conversely, the counterargument centers on the relinquishment of autonomy in favor of technological reliance, which, like all technology, is susceptible to failure via short-circuiting, hacking, or human interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the understandable hesitation towards a future dominated by autonomous vehicles, the benefits unequivocally outweigh the drawbacks. At its core, self-driving cars epitomize technological innovation, aimed at elevating life quality and streamlining daily tasks. By alleviating the stress of potential driving mishaps, self-driving cars enable passengers to focus on other pressing matters. This technology also liberates individuals reliant on public transport or personal assistance, including those with physical or mental disabilities who can now travel independently. Although cost is a concern, ongoing developments will inevitably lead to more economical production methods, making self-driving cars accessible to all.\n",

While their potential benefits are substantial, including enhanced safety through reduced accidents, immunity to distractions, optimized traffic flow, cost savings, and time efficiency, the drawbacks are equally alarming. These include dependence on favorable weather conditions, limitations in detecting human traffic signals, potential malfunctions, reliance on unmastered technologies, and adverse impacts on transportation-related jobs.\n",

      "In my opinion, the current technological landscape is not yet conducive to a seamless transition of self-driving cars into the market. Widespread adoption would likely exacerbate existing societal and economic challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several obstacles hinder the successful integration of self-driving cars into contemporary society. Firstly, their high cost (exceeding $100,000) and requisite training for safe operation render them inaccessible to all but a small, affluent segment of the population. This limited adoption would undermine the technology's full potential, as its effectiveness relies on widespread use. \n",

These outcomes would profoundly impact the livelihoods of many individuals and have a ripple effect throughout the economy.\n",

The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible: safer driving via decreased accidents, the inability for a computer to get distracted, identifying traffic problems and no longer needing a designated driver, saving money, and saving time. On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening as they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered and jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer. In other words, there is no solid evidence that self-driving cars are qualitatively safer. \n",

We need time to develop our technology in general to a point where if we were to start using them, they'd have a smooth transition into the market and outside parties would suffer as little as possible. I think they have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society but not right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we were to start using them in today's society, it wouldn't work out in many ways. Only a small percentage of the population would be able to afford them as they cost more than $100,000 and require training to operate in a safe manner. Furthermore, self-driving cars rely on being adopted by everybody and this will certainly not happen if only the richest people are able to buy them. Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road. This would be detrimental for the lives of many people and also harm the economy. Because of these reasons, 1) I don' think it is feasible to get the general public to use self-driving cars and 2) in the unlikely case that everyone uses them, it would cause damage to the economy.\n",

While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: \"They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers.\" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, which uses delicately designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically. \n",

Self-driving cars is only a small portion of it the the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.\n",

      "Second, people argue \"self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers.\" This could have a negative impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. However, this effect is short-term, for the sake of long term advancement of human history. In other words, if we forbid the development of self-driving cars because of this short-term interest, then people will improve on transportation in a long term.\n",

      "The Integration of Self-Driving Cars: Weighing the Advantages and Mitigating the Disadvantages\n",
      "\n",
      "The advent of self-driving cars has sparked intense debate across mainstream media, highlighting both the potential benefits and drawbacks of this technology in the near future. Despite the concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages, provided they are developed with long-term solutions in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Addressing Perceived Disadvantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Software Costs:** The high cost of software could be offset by federal tax credits, similar to those offered for electric vehicles. For instance, a tax credit up to $7,500, scaled according to the vehicle's technological complexity, could incentivize adoption.\n",
      "2. **Technological Failures in Unforeseen Circumstances:** Implementing a manual override switch would allow drivers to temporarily take control in situations like failed traffic signals, ensuring safety while maintaining the core accident prevention software.\n",
      "3. **Security Risks from Hacking:** Separating owner identification from the car's computer software and integrating a kill switch to safely pull the car off the road in case of a hack, would minimize potential damage, though acknowledging that complete protection is challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Outweighing Advantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dramatic Reduction in Crashes:** With approximately 80% of accidents attributed to human error—largely due to distraction or impairment—self-driving cars would significantly decrease accident rates, as influenced drivers would not control the vehicle.\n",
      "2. **Decrease in Car Insurance Costs:** Safer roads and fewer accidents could lead to lower insurance premiums. Manufacturers might even cover these costs, given the reduced risks, freeing up consumer funds for other market expenditures.\n",
      "3. **Eradication of Rush Hour Traffic and Enhanced Mobility:** \n",
      "   - **Traffic Reduction:** Platooning and inter-vehicle communication could virtually eliminate traffic buildups, slashing commute times.\n",
      "   - **Enhanced Mobility for All:** Self-driving cars would provide the elderly and those with limited mobility an unparalleled level of independence, enabling them to engage in previously inaccessible activities within their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "Embracing self-driving cars, with a focus on long-term development, could revolutionize daily life by significantly enhancing road safety, reducing costs, increasing personal time, and boosting overall societal well-being. By thoughtfully addressing the potential drawbacks, we can harness the full transformative power of this technology. \n",

      "The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets since the public sphere became aware of the role these futuristic vehicles could play in the not-to-distant future. First, there are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advanced machinery could have on modern life. These potential issues include the sheer cost of the software, the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car, as well as the security risks of the software itself. The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits. For instance, in California, people purchasing new electric vehicles can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500 depending on the size of the car's battery, and we could see a similar incentive allotted to self-driving cars in the future as their software has the potential to greatly decrease car insurance costs. Other skeptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where traffic signals have failed and police move to the intersection to direct traffic. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch that would allow a driver to take control of the wheel for a period of time so the driver may avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. The potential for the software to be targeted by hackers is another real issue that could become a major problem if the software isn't adequately protected. However, as long as information identifying the owner of each vehicle is kept separate from the car's computer software and the software that controls the cars is linked to a kill switch that could safely pull the car off the road and alert the driver, any substantial damage associated with this threat could be minimized even though the potential to completely protect from it is limited. There are, however, many advantages that I believe outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation within the car, or events happening outside, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be less responsible for people to purchase car insurance and manufacturers who are making vast amounts of money from car sales could cover the cost of the insurance, which would provide consumers with more money to use in the market. Lastly, the potential of platooning and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to due to their inability to operate a vehicle. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives, as long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution.\n",

      "Self-driving cars, though only recently becoming a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development and have thoroughly captured the public eye. The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that though it is not perfect, the prospect of driver-less roads would mark a definitive improvement over our current conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. Although it is not yet certain that self-driving cars in their current condition would cause that number to go down, the lack of human fallibility makes the prospect seem likely. Furthermore, whereas human driver tend to fall into a lull of false confidence when they have engaged in a task for an extended period of time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. There is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, self-driving cars could give society a method of transportation which is much less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are limited to those capable of operating the machinery, passing their test, and -for the most part - affording to own their own vehicle. If a child needs to be transported to any sort of extracurricular event they are bound by their parents' schedules and mobilities. If a senior citizen who has been deemed unsafe to drive decides to go shopping they must wait for long periods to use public transportation with conditions that could be extremely painful or uncomfortable with those who experience chronic pain from arthritis or similar conditions. Furthermore, many who cannot afford their own car are forced to commute long distances to their jobs, health-care, and programs, forcing a de facto restriction on who may access what. Although it is likely that one who cannot afford a regular car could not afford their own self-driving car, there is nothing to say that they must have their own. The ability to have a car drive back to the place it left from could allow a much more intricate form of car sharing; additionally, the current restrictions on insured drivers that hassle any type of shared vehicle would likely be thoroughly relaxed or missing entirely for a driver-less car. Even beyond the prospect of shared cars, self-driving vehicles could revolutionize public transportation, making a wider range of pick up locations and drop off locations feasible. If large buses or a huge fleet of public cars were to have flexible routes that could give people who do not have the means to own their own car a transportational freedom akin to it at a fraction of the price that services like Uber and Lift offer today. \n",

      "A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine much of their success and failure. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it does not seem to be a stretch to claim that this could bring us dramatic improvements.\n",

With approximately 33,000 annual fatal accidents in the US, and overwhelming evidence attributing a significant portion to human error, it is evident that improvement is necessary. While it is uncertain whether current self-driving cars would immediately reduce this number, their inherent lack of human fallibility makes a decrease likely. Unlike human drivers, who may become complacent over time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve safety through continuous learning and updates. They are impervious to distractions, sleep deprivation, intoxication, and time pressures, ensuring unwavering focus on safe transportation.\n",

      "Self-driving cars could revolutionize transportation, making it significantly less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are contingent upon operational capability, licensure, and vehicle ownership. This limits the mobility of children, senior citizens, and those with chronic conditions, forcing them to rely on others or endure uncomfortable public transportation. The shared mobility potential of self-driving cars—facilitated by their ability to return to a starting point without a driver—could provide a more intricate and accessible car-sharing system, unencumbered by traditional insurance restrictions. Moreover, integrating self-driving vehicles into public transportation could make a broader range of pickup and drop-off locations feasible, offering transportational freedom to those without means, at a fraction of the cost of current ride-sharing services.\n",

      "The overall advantages of self-driving cars, when implemented without any setbacks, are that they can be safer, cheaper, and more time saving when compared to the standard way of humans manual driving cars. Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. Self-driving cars would also be cheaper for the government by saving money that would have been spent on transit projects such as building trains. Lastly, self-driving cars would be time saving for both passengers and police officers. Passengers who would now be allowed to rest or perform work on their commute to their destination, and police officers would be able to spend less time catching speeding vehicles on the highway and more time solving more serious crimes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some disadvantages of self-driving cars are cost for creating these vehicles and complex technology/ security required to prevent serious malfunctions and hacks. For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class and rich would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. In addition, like with any technology created this 21st century there are risks for serious and even fatal malfunctions. Although not common, everyday electronics such as iPhones and laptops, concepts deemed impossible a century ago, do in fact experience problems and have stopped working for its users. While iPhones and laptops are nowhere as complex as self-driving cars, the fact of the matter is the electronic advancements made these past decades have been remarkable, but if these items have showed us anything it is that nothing is ever perfect and some software or hardware problem could always occur at any moment and without notice. It would be difficult to program self-driving cars to distinguish between new traffic laws or recent road work that occurred overnight. Also, it would be dangerous if hackers would be able to hijack vehicles and purposely take control of these self-driving vehicles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives. A human life is the only thing on earth that can't be bought no matter how much money an individual has. Death does not discriminate based on age, gender, sex, religion, race, or social status. Car accidents do occur and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident.\n",

      "Technological advances have made our society more convenient and efficient in a variety of areas, including social networking services, shopping experiences, and personalized online streaming services, although there has always been controversy on whether the technology is making our society better or worse. As we have imagined since decades ago, technologies are now being tested for cars for the purpose of creating safer self-driving cars with the use of sophisticated algorithms. However, as relying on the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect \"errors\" easily which can improve the technology continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and commute, which can be particularly hard where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are usually in hurry.\n",
      "Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we cannot predict that these risks are higher than risks associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. As there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology or not, it would be reasonable to introduce self-driving cars and create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact, fine-grained cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. Although educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, such changes require time to show the effect. \n",

With their precision, self-driving cars could also increase road capacity while decreasing congestion. Moreover, they would provide invaluable mobility for the disabled and elderly. As their adoption grows, society could reap numerous rewards: saved lives, avoided financial losses, decreased fuel consumption, and a reduced need for traffic police.\n",

While some superficial worries (e.g., a car breakdown leading to citywide chaos due to forgotten driving skills) are easily refutable – given that most individuals already lack the skills to handle a stranded vehicle – others question the technology's limitations. Concerns about performance in snowy or potholed conditions, though valid, are not insurmountable, as the technology is rapidly advancing to address such challenges.\n",

Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the catastrophic number of fatal car crashes because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the opponents of the technology have some legitimate concerns. In this category there are some superficial and trivial arguments that can be refuted right away. For example, the phobia of a scenario where a car breaks down and the human driver, having forgotten how to drive, has no idea of what to do, leading to chaos in the city cannot be a real argument against self-driving cars. Already today, an average individual has no skill to get a car to start up if it all of a sudden stops in the middle of street. Such a situation rarely disrupts a whole city! Some other arguments question the limits of the technology. What if it snows? What if the road is full of potholes (such as those in Pittsburgh!)? Well, these while valid concerns do not prove the technology insufficient. There are improvements coming every day and all those conditions will be taken care of.\n",

Achieving a high level of security while possible could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline.\n",

      "However, the biggest challenge facing self-driving cars is their popularity. The pros listed above all are predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Have you noticed that sometimes, ironically, the safest drivers, are the very cause of some accidents? Imagine a road where the speed limit is 50, but \"everyone knows that it is ok to go 60 (when the police is not around!)\". Then that one guy who sticks to that 50 mph limit is the source of frustration for those behind him/her and a possible danger for everyone involved. Thus, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with the currently high cost of these cars, and the natural public resistance to change, it seems that self-driving cars will, for the coming years, live in the margins, only triggering imagination and debates from time to time. At this point in time, we are just not ready yet to embrace them -- definitely not in large numbers.\n",

      "There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars, but the most significant advantage, in my opinion, is the enhanced safety of reduced following distances. This is achieved through continuously aware sensors, which are less prone to distractions than human drivers. Consequently, this leads to decreased traffic congestion while allowing a greater number of vehicles on the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a notable disadvantage is the potential economic impact on the gasoline industry, as manufacturers may shift towards more environmentally friendly electric fuel sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is this emphasis on environmental sustainability that underscores the benefits of self-driving cars to society. I argue that the use of eco-friendly materials and efficient technologies has a positive ripple effect: cleaner air, a healthier environment, and ultimately, a healthier population. For instance, reducing traffic congestion with electric self-driving cars decreases the time spent on the road, which in turn minimizes waste emissions and purifies the air, contributing to a healthier environment for its inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the transition to electric cars would significantly improve environmental health by mitigating the negative impacts of gasoline-powered vehicles. From personal experience, I've witnessed the hazardous effects of gas emissions from trucks and the unpleasant, unhealthy fumes at gas stations. Moreover, the risk of gasoline ignition is a serious concern, as evidenced by my own close calls with accidental spills. When preventative measures can be taken to avert dangers and diseases, society moves closer to a healthier lifestyle.\n",

      "There are many advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars but the most important advantage I find is that for self-driving cars it is safer to consistently drive closer together because it is the continuously aware sensor on the car and not the human, who can become easily distracted, that determines how close the car can be to another car. This thereby reduces traffic while still increasing the number of cars that can be on the road. The most important disadvantage I find is that for self driving cars, the electric nature of the self-driving cars may reduce the net profit of gasoline industries. This is to say, that in becoming \"new and improved\" manufacturers may stray away from using gas as fuel and move towards using electricity as fuel because this type of fuel is more environmentally friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the exact theme of being environmentally friendly by being efficient that makes me argue that self-driving cars are beneficial to society. I wish to argue that materials that make the air healthier, make the environment healthier, and then make the people who live in the environment healthier. The example allowing more cars to be on the road would make the air healthier especially if the cars were electric because the reference paper argues that this would reduce traffic and so the cars would be on the road for less time. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that less waste emitted from the energy used. This renders the air healthier and the people in this environment healthier. \n",
      "Finally, I wish to argue that the electric nature of the cars would make the environment healthier because gasoline powered cars make the environment less clean. In my experiences abroad I often saw trucks emitting black gas clouds to the point that the vision of the driver behind was impaired. When I visit the gas station, the smell of gasoline is never ignored. I do not mind the smell, but I know it is not healthy to inhale for a long time. Also, the threat of gasoline ignition is not one to ignore. I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while trying to refuel my vehicle and if there was a fire nearby this could have become more than a \"small, careless\"  mistake. All in all when changes can be made for prevention of dangerous incidents and development of diseases, then these changes move society to a healthier life style. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several advantages to start to develop onto society.\n",

      "The article \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars\" offers a comprehensive analysis of the merits of adopting self-driving vehicles. The top benefits highlighted include enhanced safety, reduced commute times, increased productivity during travel, and improved mobility for the elderly and disabled. In contrast, the article also outlines 20 drawbacks, focusing on operational training, high upfront costs, security concerns (personal and cybersecurity), legal implications, technical limitations, and the potential disruption of the automotive industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "When evaluating the trade-offs, it's essential to consider the broader context. The listed \"pros\" are universally valid, whereas many \"cons\" can be mitigated as the technology advances. For instance, the initial high cost can be offset by the historical trend of new technologies experiencing significant price drops over time, as exemplified by the rapid decrease in computer prices over the decades. Similarly, cybersecurity concerns, although pertinent, can be addressed through robust protection measures, as seen in the secure operation of military drones.\n",
      "\n",
      "While numerous examples support the potential resolution of current \"cons\" in the future, it's notable that the \"pros\" are unlikely to diminish as the technology improves. Therefore, based on this analysis, I strongly recommend the **gradual and phased adoption of self-driving vehicles into society**, allowing for the iterative refinement of the technology while harnessing its inherent benefits. \n",

      "Text2\n",
      "The article \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars\", provides an in depth look into the reasoning of whether or not we, as a society, should adopt self-driving vehicles.  Of the 20 \"pros\" listed, an increase in safety was likely the leading factor, but also included were the benefits in commute times and city travel, the possibility for the driver to do something productive in the time that would otherwise be used for driving, and the idea that elderly or disabled people would be able to ride self-driving cars without worry.  However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry. \n",
      "\n",
      "When weighing the \"pros\" and \"cons\" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The \"pros\" are all valid, while it appears that many of the \"cons\" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the \"cons\" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although several more examples supporting the idea that many of the present \"cons\" seen in self-driving vehicle adoption can be corrected in the future, it is unnecessary seeing that they are quite similar.  However, what is important to notice is that all of the \"pros\" do not seem as if they will be changing, even as the vehicles themselves improve.  Therefore I recommend the gradual adoption of self-driving vehicles into society.\n",

      "The relentless advancement of technology has consistently sparked societal debate. From the humble replacement of chalk and slates with pencils and paper in schools to the impending integration of self-driving cars, each innovation prompts crucial discussions. As we stand at the cusp of autonomous vehicles transforming our daily lives, it's essential to scrutinize the pros and cons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars, once a staple of science fiction, have evolved from a far-fetched idea just seven years ago to a tangible reality. Now, as we witness their functionality firsthand, we must delve into the benefits and drawbacks. A key advantage lies in enhanced safety. Ideally designed autonomous vehicles can surpass human driving safety standards due to their singular focus, unencumbered by human distractions, intoxication, or diversion. Additionally, self-driving cars can optimize traffic patterns through coordinated vehicle communication, maintaining safe distances and sharing road condition updates, potentially eradicating rush hour congestion. This, in turn, could lead to decreased insurance and healthcare costs, forcing a paradigm shift in these industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, several pressing concerns must be addressed before self-driving cars gain street legality. The legal and moral implications of accidents involving autonomous vehicles are complex, necessitating public discourse to resolve the inevitability of harm caused by a non-accountable computer. The long-term effect on human driving skills and the potential for technological neutering of these skills pose additional societal challenges. Moreover, the risk of hacking, already a concern for high-end digitally reliant vehicles, threatens the safety of autonomous cars. Fundamental technological hurdles, including weather resilience and GPS accuracy, must also be overcome, as rainstorms, blizzards, and visual system limitations could severely impede vehicle functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifaceted nature of this issue, the delay in the widespread adoption of fully functional autonomous vehicles is perhaps fortunate. While acknowledging the potential benefits of self-driving cars, it's crucial to confront the myriad problems that must be resolved beforehand. On a personal note, the allure of self-driving cars is overshadowed by the charm of driving one's own vehicle. The prospect of a collective shift towards characterless, device-driven transportation, potentially relegating classic cars to obsolescence, warrants a cautious approach. A prudent strategy might be to observe the technological advancements over the next decade before embracing this transformative change.@\n",

Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slates with pencil and paper in schoolhouses was a shift that created public dialogue. It is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, highlighting our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but the application of it in our day to day lives presents many important questions that first need answering.\n",
      "     Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will be able to have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because computers have one thing to focus on. They don't worried about the kids, their date, or their finances like humans do, nor can they get drunk or distracted. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more, which would all add together into a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might cease to exist! Insurance and healthcare costs would decrease with less accidents as well, and these companies might even be forced to establish a new business model. \n",
      "     However, there is always more than one side to an argument. There are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. \"Trolley problems\", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology that can be hacked and have some of their functions remotely controlled. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Rainstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem is that system can't see roads. \n",
      "     There are so many angles on this problem that its probably a good thing we are still a ways off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but I also see the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of someone else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave of pushing our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for a collective change that takes away our own individual cars and replaces them with devices that have no character. I say wait a decade and see where the technology has gone.\n",

      "Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a successful future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as police/first responders can deal with other emergencies instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation, mostly due to price, and the many troubles and hassles that will arise after implementation.\n",
      "            After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that the problems outweigh the benefits. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to afford them.\n",
      "           Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime.\n",
      "            The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions.\n",
      "            To conclude, self-driving cars are not a benefit to society. This because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking.\n",

Proponents argue that these vehicles will revolutionize transportation by reducing accidents (attributable to human error in 81% of cases), enhancing mobility for the disabled, and optimizing emergency response times. Conversely, opponents cite concerns over implementation costs and post-launch challenges. After weighing the benefits and drawbacks, I firmly believe that the latter outweigh the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "A primary concern is the exorbitant cost of self-driving cars, projected to average $100,000 upon commercial release.

      " In general, many of the pros center preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.\n",
      "There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. additionally, many people rely on providing transportation as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may effect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident?\n",
      "With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out the human errors are extremely important. With more and more cars being on the roads today, there is a higher and higher chance to be in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, I feel, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back.To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful.

By minimizing human error—a leading cause of crashes—the integrated computer system significantly reduces the risk of accidents. This includes averting disasters caused by distracted driving, such as drunk driving and texting while driving. Consequently, self-driving cars are poised to save numerous lives. Additional benefits include reduced costs, such as lower insurance premiums and the elimination of driver's education expenses.

      "After considering both sides, I firmly believe that the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks. Acknowledging my privileged position, which may enable me to afford such a vehicle (particularly with reduced insurance costs), I emphasize the paramount importance of eliminating human error. As the number of vehicles on the road increases, so does the risk of accidents caused by human mistake. Eradicating this risk would be a monumental achievement. Additionally, the potential to reclaim time currently spent driving is invaluable. As the adage goes, \"time is the one thing you can never get back.\" The ability to reduce travel time and utilize previously spent driving time productively is extremely beneficial.

      "At the core of driving challenges lies human fallibility, leading to traffic congestion, accidents, and other mishaps. Self-driving cars leverage advanced algorithms to perfect braking, obstacle avoidance, and inter-vehicle distancing, drastically reducing collisions. By removing human error, these vehicles prevent accidents caused by distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers. Although mechanical failure poses a minor risk, it pales in comparison to the dangers of human driving.\n",

      "**Embracing Progress**\n",
      "While caution is advised when integrating new technologies, self-driving cars promise to enhance our driving experiences, grant us more time, and ensure our safety. By embracing this innovation, we pave the way for a more efficient, safer, and more leisurely future. \n",

      "What once seemed like a faraway science fiction fantasy is now becoming a reality. Testing of self-driving cars is happening right here and now in our city of Pittsburgh. As technology advances and becomes ever more a part of our daily lives, we must consider the consequences of embracing the shiny and new. Though there are risks associated with adopting self-driving car technology into our society, the benefits of doing so greatly outweigh the risks. Because of this, we should stand for self-driving car technology and its benefits to society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever been trapped in an unnecessary traffic slowdown? Have you thought about how much time and gas you could save if the roadways and cars operated more efficiently? Have you ever been concerned about public safety because of dangerous drivers who may be distracted, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise impaired? All of these problems could be solved with self-driving cars. The widespread use of self-driving cars could improve efficiency of roadways, free up time and resources for members of society, and eliminate the human error of driving, improving roadway safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "If self-driving cars ruled the roadway, your riding experience would be much more enjoyable. According to Eno Transportation, when self-driving cars communicate and work together on the road, they are able to improve traffic conditions and congestion. They are also able to identify road risks early on to avoid further frustration during your ride. The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road. Though this is a legitimate concern, it should be tempered with the knowledge that methods for hacking prevention are on the rise since this is a concern in all technological aspects of our lives like our personal computers and cell phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars also reduce commute times and would maximize gasoline usage. This would create more free time in the lives of drivers and passengers everywhere. Not only would it create time directly through commute reduction, but it would also potentially allow drivers to spend time in the car doing other things like reading or talking with other passengers, as highlighted by a recent article in Forbes. It could be argued that drivers will still need to maintain focus while riding in self-driving cars. This may be true initially, but as the technology improves and becomes more widespread, passive driving will become a reality. Reduced costs associated with gasoline are just an added benefit for society!\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes down to it, human error is the source of difficulties with driving. Traffic, congestion, and car accidents are all a result of humans being imperfect drivers. Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Self-driving cars would take human error out of the picture, preventing distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers from causing fatal car accidents. Though there is always the small risk of mechanical failure to result in an accident, this risk is minute compared to the risk of humans being behind the wheel.\n",
      "\n",

      "Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and democratize commuting. On the other hand, the technology also raises a number of concerns, e.g. security, safety, and economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, I support self-driving cars. The technology will have positive impacts on the society. First, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it eliminates mistakes made by a human, such as driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tiredness). Moreover, drivers tend to have a false confidence over time. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Second, we will save a lot of money with this technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Consequently, we can save the cost of gas and our traveling time. Last but not least, self-driving cars democratize commuting and put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, they only operate on a pre-designated route and stop at particular locations (e.g. bus stops) rather than the travelers' desired destinations (a coffee shop on a small street) and schedules (after midnight). Furthermore, self-driving cars also provide private space for the travelers while in public transportations the travelers must share the space with many strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: the not-ready and the not-true groups. The not-ready group contains arguments of new challenges of the technology that our society has not addressed, e.g. legal responsibility and security. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? What would car-makers or software designers handle moral-sensitive situations? For example, which choice should be made by the self-driving car given an unavoidable accident killing either an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement? Security is another critical issue, such as how can drivers protect their personal data or even the self-driving cars if the vehicles are hacked? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. On the other hand, the not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology, e.g. human drivers' skills, different traffic regulations, interpreting police officers' signals, or human workers. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuff. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. Another false opinion is the traffic regulation differences between states, e.g. turning right on red or not. In fact, cars can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. They said that cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. However, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, police officers do not bother going down the streets and directs the traffic. The officers just send information to the cars through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars and this will affect human workers. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs to be manufactured. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.\n",
      "\n",

      "Self-driving cars have sparked intense debate in recent times. On one hand, they offer numerous benefits, including enhanced safety, cost savings, and increased mobility for all. On the other hand, concerns about security, safety, and economic impact have been raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I advocate for self-driving cars, believing they will positively transform our society. Firstly, by eliminating human errors - such as driving under the influence or due to fatigue - self-driving cars significantly enhance road safety. Additionally, the false confidence that often develops in human drivers, increasing the likelihood of accidents, is mitigated. Secondly, widespread adoption of self-driving cars, which can communicate with each other, will optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and unknown traffic conditions. This, in turn, will save both fuel costs and travel time. Lastly, self-driving cars democratize mobility, providing equitable access for individuals with travel difficulties, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which is limited by fixed routes and schedules, self-driving cars offer direct, private travel to desired destinations at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerns about self-driving cars can be categorized into two main groups: unresolved challenges and misconceptions. The first group includes unaddressed legal and security issues. For instance, questions of liability in the event of an accident, how vehicles will handle morally complex decisions, and the security of personal data against hacking must be resolved before mass deployment. Conversely, the second group comprises misconceptions about the technology. These include fears about the erosion of human driving skills, incompatibility with varying traffic regulations, the inability to interpret police signals, and job losses in the automotive manufacturing sector. However, these concerns are unfounded: individuals can always seek assistance for car troubles, self-driving cars can update their algorithms based on location, police can direct traffic through digital means, and the manufacturing of self-driving cars will actually sustain, if not increase, demand in the automotive industry, as evidenced by the growing number of manufacturers involved, including Volvo, BMW, Toyota, and Honda.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while self-driving cars promise a revolutionary benefit to society, it is crucial that the outstanding concerns are addressed to ensure the technology's universal adoption and success. \n",

      "Equipped with multiple sensors and advanced algorithms, a self-driving car is more likely to be an ideal driver; a self-driving car is more accurate, reliable, and focused than a human driver. However, engineers are still researching the self-driving technology. Many practical questions need be answered. For example, who will  drive the car if the technology fails? This op-ed article will convince you that we should not use self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, like human, technology could fail. Who will shoulder the responsibility of driving when the technology fails? We know that there is a big circulating head on top of a self-driving car. It is the “eye” and “ear” of the car. When a human driver is  navigating through a storm, they use their senses to make informed decisions. However, in extreme conditions, the “eye” and the “ear” of the car might be damaged. A “blind” driver cannot safely operate a car. In addition, self-driving cars might discourage prospective drivers from attending driver’s education courses. In the case of failed technology, unskilled human operators are not ready to shoulder the responsibility of driving, and there are consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who should be responsible for the consequences caused by a malfunctioning self-driving car? When a self-driving car malfunctions, the people inside of the car may not be able to gain control quickly. An accident could easily happen during the  time lapsed between a mechanical failure and an attempt to gain control over the car. In a court of law, it is very difficult to determine who is responsible in this case. We do not want accidents: we want reliable technology.\n",

      "Proponents of self-driving cars argue that self-driving cars reduce the cost of driving and alleviate societal burden. On the contrary, the cost of self-driving cars is much high than expected.The research dollars that companies poured into testings will be paid by the consumers in the long run. In addition, self-driving cars are equipped with sensors that carry a high maintenance and replacement fee. A self-driving car is still a luxury for the general public. The benefits of self-driving cars cannot be reaped if they are not widely used. Additionally, unemployment rates would roar for the transportation industry because machines will replace human labors.

The computer running the car won’t be distracted like humans. The average attention span is only eight seconds so a person might not respond fast enough to a deer in the headlights or a bicyclist going past. Human error causes 94% of traffic accidents. Most traffic accidents are caused by drunk and distracted driving.\n",

      "A self-driving car will prevent many accidents especially ones caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk or text on their cell phones, eat and drink, talk to people in their vehicle, or play with the radio/CD player while driving which is highly dangerous. Children, pets, conversations, and preoccupations such as applying makeup can distract a driver.\n",

An electric car is very quiet and very smooth compared to gas operated cars which are clunky and outdated. Electric cars are cheaper to operate so have a big cost advantage over gas. Electric cars are also more efficient so cost about one-third to one-quarter the cost of gasoline. Maintenance costs are less since electric cars don’t need oil changes.

Some people may argue that starting up a new technique will spend too much money. Despite having so many challenges, researches in self-driving cars are promising in my opinion. I believe that self-driving cars can help people to save their time, reduce the number of traffic accidents, and provide freedom and benefit to the disabled and the elder. \n",
      "To me, the most important benefit that self-driving car can bring is that it can save us from wasting too much time driving and parking. While the computer is looking up the map and calculating distances, people in the car can enjoy themselves. Besides, the platooning among self-driving cars can partially solve congestion. This will decrease the amount of time people need to spend on the roads. Furthermore, if the computational algorithm is accurate enough, people no longer need a strict speed limit. People using a self-driving car will be able to drive faster and hence save their time. Additionally, sensors in cars may allow cars to ride closer to each other. With more car on the road, people will have less traffic jam and navigate more efficiently. As you can see, the self-driving car can significantly save our time used in transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another critical aspect is that self-driving car can save our lives. Let us first admit that as one of the most intelligent creatures on earth, we can be very easily distracted. We might be careful at the very beginning, but after a few months of driving, we assume that we are expert drivers and pay much less attention to the road. Our mind flows away when we drive before we notice. Besides, human drivers are not always reliable. There are millions of people driving under the effect of alcohol or drug. And there are more people driving when they are exhausted, sleepy or grumpy. According to the Center for Disease Control, “Many of [traffic] accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving.” Compared to humans, AI can never be distracted when driving. Neither can it be drunk, sick or tired. It uses a complicated algorithm and communicates with another self-driving car to ensure traffic safety. Thus, it is better to let AI take the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also worthy of notice that self-driving cars can allow the elder and the disabled to drive. Without an AI driver, they have to rely heavily on public transportation or other people in order to travel. However, you cannot expect buses to arrive whenever you want. Friends or family members are not available at 24/7 too. Hence, self-driving cars can be your loyal friends. Therefore, self-driving cars can allow the disabled and elder citizens to drive.\n",

      "The growth of technology and machines has been at its panache in the 21st century. Humans have found a way to automate every possible task using the availability of high computing power and sophisticated algorithms. Driving has been a passion for some and mundane task for others but can be considered an important skill to have. Recent improvements in road infrastructure has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane task of driving and can specifically help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for who pursue this as a job rather than a passion or a personal choice. However I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles as that can have certain consequences which are not that necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of us millennial's these days start driving at an early age, growing worldwide economy, availability of cheaper cars have helped the gap and luxury to drive a car in recent time. Self-driving cars which can drastically reduce the effort required in driving can be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, and it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are also a symbol of personal freedom. Developed countries like the United States cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars and we should concern tougher testing grounds for proper implementation. Also success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in their middle and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into even more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can lead to major issues and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator to understand this and can lead to major accidents within seconds due to lack of manual control. Himalayan roads where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of any malfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, self-driving vehicles can be great research idea but are exact real world implementation is limited due to multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs It is much easier to successfully implement such project in developed nations and in constrained environment but not feasible everywhere around the world.\n",

      "The 21st century has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, with automation transforming numerous aspects of life. Driving, a skill once deemed essential, is now on the cusp of revolution with Self-Driving Cars (SDCs). While SDCs can alleviate the monotony of driving, particularly for professional drivers, their implementation raises concerns that outweigh their benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widespread adoption of driving among millennials, facilitated by improved road infrastructure and affordable vehicles, renders SDCs beneficial to some but redundant to others. Notably, regions with challenging terrains, like the Himalayan foothills, pose significant driving challenges that SDCs may not fully address. The success of SDCs in countries like the United States, known for its robust infrastructure and car culture, may not translate globally. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several concerns hinder the universal implementation of SDCs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Infrastructure and GPS Limitations**: SDCs rely heavily on accurate mapping systems, which are not universally available, particularly in areas with unreliable GPS signals due to weather conditions.\n",
      "2. **Machine Learning and Algorithmic Fallibility**: Despite advancements in machine learning, SDC algorithms can still fail, leading to potentially catastrophic outcomes in unforeseen scenarios.\n",
      "3. **Technophobia and Operational Challenges**: Many, especially the middle-aged and elderly, are hesitant to cede control to machines, potentially leading to malfunctions and increased danger.\n",
      "4. **Exorbitant Implementation Costs**: The financial burden of implementing SDCs on a large scale, including the prerequisite for perfect road infrastructure, outweighs the anticipated utility.\n",
      "5. **Accident Reduction Skepticism**: Recent incidents involving SDCs in accidents have cast doubt on their ability to completely eliminate accidents, highlighting the risk of malfunctions and the challenge of human operators responding effectively in such situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: While Self-Driving Cars represent an intriguing research concept, their real-world implementation is severely constrained by infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, financial viability, and safety concerns. Successful implementation may be feasible in developed nations with controlled environments, but it remains impractical for global adoption at this juncture. \n",

      "Self-driving cars might still sound like something from a sci-fi story, but these automobiles are finding their way onto the road more and more. Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars also have the potential to save lives. They rectify the lingering issue of drunk or drug-influenced drivers who should not be operating normal motor vehicles. These advanced cars would also decrease distracted drivers or tired drivers on the road. This article cites the CDC and points out that “fatalities from traffic accidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people.” The impaired drivers mentioned previously contribute to this statistic. When unsafe drivers are taken out of the driver’s seat, the overall safety of people everywhere increases.\n",
      "The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. A normal car, like what we are used to, can also fail, so that argument doesn’t quite stand on solid ground. The more we learn about what makes the best self-driving car, though, the safer and less likely to fail we can make the cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there will always be the “what ifs” of self-driving cars, we can’t let that stop us from innovating. With self-driving cars, commuters and pedestrians gain an increased sense of security and well-being.\n",

      "The self-driving car is a groundbreaking piece of technology. There is no doubt about that. However, I really question how feasible it is to transition them into every day life in America. The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible. Safer driving would be accomplished by decreasing accidents due to the inability for a computer to get distracted and no longer needing a designated driver. The identification of traffic problems, faster speed limits and the ability to be dropped off would save people time. It would also save many individuals money due to lower insurance and healthcare costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening:  they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered  and they would cause jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer. In other words, there is no solid evidence that self-driving cars would be a true benefit to society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, I don't think it is the time to bring them out and try to adopt them into society. We need time to develop our technology to a point where if we were to start using them, they'd have a smooth transition into the market and outside parties would suffer as little as possible. I think they have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society but not right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we were to start using them in today's society, it wouldn't work out in many ways. Only a small percentage of the population would be able to afford them as they would initially cost more than $100,000 and require time and resource-heavy training to operate in a safe manner. Furthermore, self-driving cars rely on being adopted by everybody and this will certainly not happen if only the richest people are able to buy them. This is because their safety is created only when the road consists of an entire network of driverless cars communicating with one another.  Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road. This would be detrimental for the lives of many people and also harm the economy. Because of these reasons, 1) I don' think it is feasible to get the general public to use self-driving cars and 2) in the unlikely case that everyone uses them, it would cause damage to the economy.  \n",

      "The benefits of self-driving cars are numerous, with two key advantages standing out. Firstly, they significantly enhance driving safety. While mechanical faults can sometimes cause accidents, human error is the predominant culprit. As emphasized by Chris Urmson, Google's Director of the Self-Driving Car Program, \"These vehicles are more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers.\" Computers, utilizing meticulously designed algorithms to determine optimal stopping distances and vehicle proximity, drastically reduce the likelihood of car accidents.\n",

      "Secondly, the argument that self-driving cars will eradicate jobs in the transportation sector, particularly in freight and taxi services, is a short-term concern. While this may temporarily impact unemployment rates and the economy, we must prioritize long-term progress. Halting self-driving car development due to job market concerns would mean forfeiting opportunities for transformative advancements in transportation and the economy.\n",

      "\n",
      "We are the history viewers of how self-driving cars are right changing our transportation choices. As the name indicates, self-driving cars can move in a controlled manner without any operation of human. Alongside the technology of self-driving cars that has emerged during this time while not yet fully realized, the debate on the pros vs. cons of self-driving cars has already started to rage on. Whether it is a gift from God, or just another devil jumping out from Pandora's Box? People hold different ideas. But are self-driving cars really that controversial? If they are, then why hundreds of huge companies, including Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, Tencent, are now dramatically \"wasting\" their money on the research of self-driving cars?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article we certainly believe that self-driving ARE the most beautiful gifts endowed by our God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are uncountable benefits of self-driving cars. Among them there are two prominent ones. The first regards on the driving safety. While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: \"They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers.\" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, as it uses carefully designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that can decrease significantly the chance of car accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second advantage is that self-driving cars can benefit those people in desperate help. One fact is that self-driving cars can help people move freely who are not suited to driving, such as the handicapped, the drunk or senior citizens. With self-driving cars, their reliance on public transportation or assistance from others to get around would become very minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the obvious benefits, there are pessimistic people who may be bothered by some potential risks brought by self-driving cars. Here we would list out two of the most controversial issues which, however, are not problems at all, in our opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly of all, some individuals are concerned about the chance that a computer built into the self-driving car can collect personal data. Indeed, we have that risk. However, in the future with the development of computers and AI, every device or item in our life will get electronicalized and the information of them will flow through the internet of things (IOT), which is designed to make our life more intelligent. Self-driving cars are only a small portion of it and thus the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, people argue \"self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers.\" Indeed, this could have a impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. Nevertheless, this negative effect is short-term. For the sake of long-term advancement of human history, we need self-driving cars. If we stop the development of self-driving cars just because of the worry on the unemployment rate, then people lose the opportunity to improve our transportation and economy in the long run.\n",

      "The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets, but there are clear advantages and even fairly simple solutions to the potential disadvantages that suggest the benefits of this technology. There are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advancement could have on modern life. These more reasonable issues foreseen include the sheer cost of the software and the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car. However, are far more advantages that greatly outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. \n",
      "The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits, such as in California where one can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500. Due to a substantial decline in insurance costs for self-driving cars, the potential for a tax credit to incentivise purchase from the general public is high. Other sceptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where a loss of power has shut off traffic signals. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch so the driver may take control of the vehicle to avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. \n",
      "Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error that can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation, events happening outside the vehicle, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be a decreased responsibility for consumers to purchase car insurance and manufacturers of the vehicles could Insure the software controlling the car, which would just leave a potential smaller insurance plan for drivers who might take control of the vehicle. Lastly, the potential of platooning, which decreases the distance between vehicles to increase road capacity, and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which would, in turn, substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to perform due to their inability to operate a vehicle. \n",
      "Decreased fees, lower insurance premiums, safer roads, and increased access are just a few of the many potential benefits a community could experience from this technology. The theoretical see-saw that exemplifies this debate can be pushed in either direction, however as the technology advances and is updated to become a part of our country's infrastructure the benefits will surely outweigh the disadvantages. As long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution, it could easily become engrained within our society within generations.\n",

While guaranteed outcomes are elusive, considering the profound limitations of our current system, it is reasonable to assert that self-driving cars could bring about substantial improvements. \n",

      "Self-driving cars, though only recently becoming a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development and have thoroughly captured the public eye. The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that, though they have the potential to cause societal harm, given the distressing array of negative societal impacts associated with human-driven cars, the apparent feasibility for self-driving cars to ameliorate these issues makes it only rational to welcome their implementation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these, it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. \n",
      "\n",
      "While no one would rightly argue that our current system is ideal, skepticism toward self-driving cars at this stage is more than fair. The development of the vehicles is very much still in its developmental phases and without a fully computerized automotive environment computer-human scuffles could arise more often than current human-human scuffles do. While a definitive answer to this question would require currently non-existent empirical studies, there are good reasons to believe that even in computer-human interactions the computer would be the better bet.  Whereas human drivers tend to fall into a lull of false confidence after driving for many years, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. Further, there is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. In the absence of such risks, a computer car very well might behave safer even without the ability to intuitively grasp tendencies and perceptions of neighboring human drivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Others however, are more concerned about the societal impact of these cars than their safety specs. Even if the change means less lives lost on the road, it still may be an unwise one if it leads to the ruin of lives off the road. Given the number of transportation jobs, a computerized revolution could displace the occupations of many currently employed drivers. Furthermore, given the massive economic investment needed to own such a car, might this lead the widening of already egregious inequality gaps in the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "The transportation industry represents a real threat if we have no place for the newly unemployed to turn. This however, is not a problem unique to self-driving cars but one that is encroaching on us from all directions with the rapid advance of technological competency. If we cannot as a society, solve this more generally, the threats will be realized even in the absence of the driver-less car revolution; if we do find a way to support the displaced workers of other sectors I remain hopeful that such approaches can be implemented to this sector as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for societal inequality, self-driving vehicles, if implemented properly, could actually be a great boon to economically struggling classes. To begin, the previously considered transportation industry automation, though bad for workers, could be fantastic for commodity prices. If the cost of all daily goods dropped, many would be the better for it. Further, current systems of public transportation are woefully insufficient to serve their desired societal role. When jobs, hospitals, and enrichment events are inconvenient to access, attendance from under serviced individuals tends to drop. This creates a de-facto restriction on who may access what. With an automated public transportation system, it could be much easier to introduce flexible pick-up locations, drop-off spots, and schedules. With a more functional and convenient public transportation system we could relieve both the economic burden of buying a vehicle as well as the logistical burden of navigating tricky and time-consuming bus routes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine much of their success and failure. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it does not seem to be a stretch to claim that this could bring us dramatic improvements.\n",

      "There are significant advantages and disadvantages to integrating self-driving cars into our society. The primary benefits of self-driving cars are enhanced safety and reduced costs. By eliminating the human element, self-driving cars mitigate the risks associated with distracted driving, such as texting or falling asleep at the wheel. Additionally, their programmed ability to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid collisions would lead to a substantial decrease in car accidents. This, in turn, would translate to considerable cost savings, as highlighted by the US Department of Transportation's valuation of a human life at $9.2 million, thereby reducing high insurance and healthcare expenditures stemming from car accidents.\n",

      "Ultimately, self-driving cars would vastly benefit society, primarily by reducing distracted driving, which would decrease car accidents and save lives. In an era where technology aims to better our society, the life-saving potential of self-driving cars presents a compelling reason for their adoption. Given the alarming rate of car accident fatalities (approximately 33,000 annually, as per the CDC), with most attributed to distracted driving, self-driving cars offer a solution by eliminating human distractions. Although the initial cost of developing and purchasing self-driving cars may seem prohibitive, ongoing technological advancements and manufacturing updates could eventually make them accessible to all. To prevent unnecessary fatalities, society should at least explore the implementation of self-driving cars, as the long-term benefits, including the priceless value of saving lives, would outweigh the initial costs and waiting period for widespread affordability.\n",

      "There are many advantages and disadvantages for using self-driving cars in our society today. The overall advantages of self-driving cars are that they are safer and cheaper. Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. \n",
      "\n",
      "One big disadvantage of self-driving cars are the cost for them, which may prevent a majority of the population from using them once they become available. For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars, then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives? Car accidents have always occurred since they were first created, and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident.\n",

Drastic changes that technologies can bring to our lives are sometimes not easily accepted by society due to the potential disadvantages that might make our lives worse. One of such controversial topics currently being discussed is self-driving cars. Academic institutions and industry have started testing the practical use of the self-driving technology, but as the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect \"errors\" easily which can improve the technology continuously.\n",

      "First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and/or commute, which can be particularly hard especially in a location where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are in hurry.\n",

      "Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we still do not know whether these risks are higher than those associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. In other words, there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology. When there is no evidence that self-driving cars cause more accidents, it is reasonable and more important to promote self-driving cars which can create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.\n",

      "Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. A variety of educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, but such changes require time to prove their actual impact.\n",

      "\n",
      "Unlike bicycles, which have undergone significant transformations over time, cars have maintained a relatively consistent design. However, the emergence of self-driving cars is poised to revolutionize the automotive industry. With several models already tested on public roads, the debate surrounding their benefits and drawbacks has intensified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents of autonomous vehicles argue that they will drastically reduce fatal car crashes, as machines are immune to distractions, intoxication, and other human errors. Additionally, they cite the potential for coordinated speed management and optimized traffic flow, leading to decreased congestion and travel times. Furthermore, self-driving cars could greatly benefit the disabled and elderly, providing unparalleled mobility. Once a substantial proportion of vehicles on the road are autonomous, advocates claim that society as a whole will reap numerous benefits, including saved lives, reduced financial losses, lower fuel consumption, and decreased need for traffic enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite the allure of this technology, I must side with the critics. Several pressing concerns undermine the predicted advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Economic Viability**: Establishing a highly secure, interconnected network for data exchange between vehicles will be prohibitively costly. As highlighted by The Guardian, the risk of hacking poses a significant threat. The production costs of these complex vehicles will be substantially higher than their traditional counterparts. Even with a reduced accident rate, the increased damage to expensive autonomous cars and the need for specialized repair staff and customer support will incur significant expenses, casting doubt on their cost-efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scalability and Adoption**: The touted benefits of autonomous cars are contingent upon their widespread adoption. With only a small percentage of self-driving cars on the road, the effects on safety, traffic coordination, and congestion will be negligible. In fact, the presence of a few autonomous vehicles among human drivers could lead to accidents caused by human misinterpretation of their behavior. The advantages will only materialize once a substantial portion of the population adopts this technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Societal Acceptance**: The high cost of autonomous cars may render them a luxury item, limiting their adoption. Additionally, people's natural aversion to drastic change, the perceived loss of control, and ethical concerns (e.g., programming cars to prioritize minimizing fatalities by potentially endangering their own passengers) may hinder the transition to driverless traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Conclusion**: While acknowledging the engineering feat, I believe society is not yet ready for this revolution. The concerns surrounding economic viability, scalability, and societal acceptance must be thoroughly addressed before self-driving cars can truly transform our transportation landscape.

However, something on the horizon might turn everything about cars upside down: self-driving cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several models have been tested on streets already and that settles the question from engineering and technological point of view. It fuels the debate about their promises and threats to the society.\n",

      "Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the stunning number of fatal car crashes, because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "As utopian as the technology seems, I have to side with the critics of the technology. There are several serious issues with the predictions above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, self-driving cars will not necessarily be economical. There will be need for an extremely cyber secure and delicate network of interconnected software that store and communicate data between cars. If, as Guardian suggests, there is a potential for hackers to manipulate such a system, then it will be a true disaster. Achieving a high level of security could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline. The manufacturing of the cars will require complex software and hardware and production cost will be higher than the average today. Even with the autonomous cars driving accidents could and will occur. Maybe the number of accidents will be lower, but remember that the damage befallen on these expensive cars will be higher. There are other expenses we can foresee: staff that can repair the cars, customer service that can help out a baffled and helpless human passenger in a car,... Therefore, it is not clear whether self-driving cars will in fact be cost-efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly,  the pros listed for autonomous cars are all predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Self-driving cars can reduce the number of accidents only if they make up a significant percentage of all traffic. A handful of them among human drivers could in fact lead to human misinterpretation of their behavior and lead to accidents. Imagine a driverless car passing by inches by your car at a high speed. It could be that the machine \"knows\" what it's doing, but what if the human driver makes the mistake under the panic he or she experiences? Again, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will the society in fact adopt them? As mentioned above, the merits of self-driving cars are dependent on their taking up a good portion of the traffic. If they don't, then they can turn into clumsy, ultra cautious drivers that we all hate so much! People have good reasons to not embrace the technology -- number one being their cost. Cars are already expensive and if the autonomous cars cannot compete with the traditional ones in terms of cost, they will remain a luxury item. Other reasons may include people natural phobia of drastic changes. We do hear people not willing to \"give up the control\" and \"joy of driving\". Such personal associations with cars and ethical issues (such as cars being programmed to minimize fatalities in an eventful situation by \"directing the danger toward its own passengers\") may turn out to be strong concerns for people that come in te way of transition to a driverless traffic.\n",
      "\n",

      "The term \"Self-Driving Car\" inherently conveys both benefits and concerns. In my opinion, the most significant advantage is its potential to optimize traffic flow by enabling cars to drive closely together while maintaining safety. This is achieved through advanced sensors that continuously monitor and adjust the distance between adjacent vehicles, eliminating human error. As a result, more cars can share the road simultaneously, reducing congestion and the risk of accidents, which often occur when humans misjudge safe distances.\n",

      "The name, Self-Driving Car, in itself elicit advantages, but then also fear and therefore some disadvantages. However, in my own view, the most important advantage is that this new technology makes it easier for cars to drive close together continuously and still have flowing traffic. This is to say, the continuously aware sensor judges the practiced distance between adjacent cars, not the human. This implies that the method in which cars drive close together to reduce traffic is not hazardous. The program determines the safe minimum distance and then as a result, more cars can be on the road at the same time without having slow car flow or slow traffic. As experience shows, sometimes humans misestimate the safe minimum distance and this can lead to wasted space on the road or car crashes. One can then see that not only can the roads be more efficient for travel, but also reduction in car crashes can make the roads less dangerous.  \n",

      "As mentioned before, the name, Self-Driving Cars, can also elicit fearer. One such fearer is the gasoline industry. Many in this field may reason that if the self-driving car is electric, the demand for gasoline will decline. Those who reason as such are not far from the truth.  If there is less of a demand for gasoline fuel, these industries are indeed at risk for reduction in their net profit. Unfortunately, for advocates of the gasoline industry, the imagery of “new and improved” does include electricity as the new and improved from gasoline fuel.

If there is more oxygen with which our bodies can produce energy, then in the long-term the people in this environment can have healthier states of homeostasis. For example, the reference paper argued that Self-driving cars would reduce the time that cars on the road. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that, the energy used would emit less waste. This then can render the air more free of waste over time, and the people using the air healthier.\n",
      "Finally, the electric nature of the cars compared to the dirty nature of gasoline would make the environment cleaner. Yes, I have introduced in the previous section the idea of less time for gas emission waste and/or electric emission waste equates to cleaner air. Not only does the fuel affect air’s cleanliness but also land’s cleanliness. For example, I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while refueling my vehicle. If there was an adjacent fire nearby, a \"small, careless” mistake could have become a great fire. This fire would affect land’s cleanliness. An unclean land can affect the inhabitants of the land. Self-driving cars can help prevent such incidents that can make the land unclean. A cleaner land and air can make the people healthier. Therefore, “Self driving cars” can help move society forward to better health. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several societal advantages to start sprouting, and one of those advantages is better health.\n",

      "The article \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars\", provides an in depth look into the reasoning of whether or not we, as a society, should adopt self-driving vehicles.  Of the 20 \"pros\" listed, an increase in safety was likely the leading factor, but also included were the benefits in commute times and city travel, the possibility for the driver to do something productive in the time that would otherwise be used for driving, and the idea that elderly or disabled people would be able to ride self-driving cars without worry.  However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this article and other available literature and research focused on self-driving vehicles, I truly believe a gradual implementation into our society would be quite beneficial. When weighing the \"pros\" and \"cons\" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The \"pros\" are all valid currently and it appears that they will still be valid moving forward, while many of the \"cons\" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the \"cons\" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles. Although several more examples supporting the idea that many of the present \"cons\" seen in self-driving vehicle adoption can be corrected in the future are present, it is unnecessary seeing that they are quite similar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, what is important to notice is that all of the \"pros\" do not seem as if they will be changing, even as the vehicles themselves improve.  From my viewpoint, integrating self-driving cars into society should make driving safer and will allow for lower commute times, better access for the elderly and disabled, and the opportunity for the driver to accomplish something else in the time that would otherwise be wasted by driving.\n",

      "The article \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars\" provides a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of adopting autonomous vehicles. Upon examining the listed advantages, increased safety, reduced commute times, enhanced productivity during travel, and improved mobility for the elderly and disabled stand out as key benefits. Conversely, the article highlights 20 disadvantages, including training requirements, high upfront costs, security concerns (both personal and cybersecurity), legal implications, technical limitations, and the potential economic disruption to traditional industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "After considering this article and additional research on self-driving cars, I firmly believe that a gradual integration into our society would be highly beneficial. When evaluating the pros and cons, it's essential to consider the broader context. The listed advantages remain pertinent and are likely to endure, whereas many of the disadvantages can be mitigated as the technology advances. For instance, the initial high cost, often cited as a deterrent, tends to decrease significantly over time, as exemplified by the rapid price drop of early computers. Similarly, cybersecurity concerns, although valid, can be effectively addressed, as seen in the protection of critical infrastructure like military drones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the benefits of self-driving cars appear to be more stable and less susceptible to change as the technology improves. From my perspective, incorporating self-driving cars into society will likely enhance road safety, reduce commute times, provide greater accessibility for vulnerable populations, and offer drivers the opportunity to utilize their time more productively. A phased implementation would allow for the refinement of the technology, addressing concerns while harnessing the numerous benefits, ultimately leading to a safer, more efficient, and more inclusive transportation system. \n",

      "The relentless progress of technology often sparks societal debate, with even seemingly minor innovations, like the shift from chalk to pencil in schools, generating public discussion. It's no surprise, then, that the introduction of self-driving cars on our streets is a highly contested issue today. While the technology embodies our problem-solving prowess, its practical application raises crucial questions that demand attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars have transitioned from science fiction to reality, with their development accelerating over the past seven years. Now, as we witness their functionality firsthand, it's imperative to weigh their pros and cons. One of the most compelling advantages is enhanced safety. An optimally designed autonomous vehicle inherently boasts a higher safety rating than human drivers, as it focuses solely on the road, unencumbered by distractions, intoxication, or daydreaming. Additionally, self-driving cars can revolutionize traffic patterns by coordinating across vehicles, maintaining consistent distances, and sharing road condition updates, potentially rendering rush hour obsolete and decreasing insurance and healthcare costs due to reduced accidents. These benefits span multiple sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, several critical concerns must be addressed before self-driving cars gain street legality. The legal and moral implications of an autonomous vehicle involved in an accident are profound, necessitating public discourse to reconcile the unavoidable harm caused by an unaccountable computer. This technology's widespread adoption may also erode our driving skills, introducing new societal challenges. Moreover, manufacturers must prioritize hacking concerns, given the existing vulnerability of high-tech vehicles to remote control breaches, which could jeopardize lives. Furthermore, unresolved technological hurdles include weather resilience and GPS accuracy, with adverse weather conditions and system blind spots posing significant risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the multifaceted nature of this issue, it's fortunate that fully functional autonomous vehicles are still in the development stage. While acknowledging the potential benefits, this writer also recognizes the extensive problems requiring resolution. Personally, the appeal of autonomous vehicles is overshadowed by the attachment to driving one's own car. The advent of self-driving cars might usher in an era where fleets of anonymous, unaccountable vehicles dominate the roads, displacing beloved classic cars. A prudent approach would be to reassess the technology in a decade, allowing for more comprehensive evaluation and refinement.@\n",

      "The forward march of technology has always been a source of controversy in society. Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slate with pencil and paper in schoolhouses created public dialogue, so it is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, exemplifying our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but its application in our day to day lives presents many important questions that need to be answered first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will  have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because the computer only needs to focus on the road. They don't worried about kids, their days, or their hectic schedule like humans do, nor can they get drunk or daydream. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more! This would result in a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might become a thing of the past, insurance and healthcare costs would decrease because of the reduced number of accidents. There are a plethora of benefits to self - driving cars across multiple fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. \"Trolley problems\", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Also, hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology which have been hacked to give a remote user full control of a vehicle. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Thunderstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem if that system goes blind every time it rains.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many angles to this problem that its probably a good thing we are still far off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but also the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of something else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave that pushes our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for fleets of autonomous vehicles with no identity, reliability, or accountability. I say wait a decade and see where the technology is then.\n",

      "Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a successful future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as police/first responders can deal with other emergencies instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation and the many troubles and hassles that will arise after implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "        After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that self-driving cars are more of a detriment to society than benefit. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to afford them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised as mentioned by the Guardian. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, the whole idea of having self-driving cars can be thrown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions to society. This is because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking.\n",

      "Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize the automotive industry within the next several years, yet the debate surrounding their potential impact remains intense. Proponents argue that these vehicles will significantly reduce accidents (81% of which are caused by human error), enhance transportation accessibility for the disabled, and optimize emergency response times. Conversely, opponents cite the challenges of implementation and post-launch complications. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks, I firmly believe that self-driving cars will ultimately prove more detrimental to society than beneficial. Firstly, their exorbitant cost upon commercial release will render them inaccessible to the average American, with a projected average price of $100,000. The requisite expensive machinery will create a significant financial barrier, undermining the potential benefits for the broader population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the widespread adoption of self-driving technology across various transportation modes (trucks, buses, planes, and trains) will inevitably displace millions of workers in the transportation sector. This disruption will lead to widespread unemployment, potentially driving individuals to crime, and severely impacting the economy. While enhanced road safety and efficiency are notable advantages, the devastating job losses and economic repercussions cannot be overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the susceptibility of self-driving cars to hacking, as highlighted by The Guardian, severely compromises their primary safety benefit. The risk of vehicles being manipulated to crash or lose control undermines the fundamental rationale for their adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, self-driving cars pose more problems than solutions for society, primarily due to their prohibitively high cost, the catastrophic job losses and economic instability they will inflict, and their vulnerability to cyber threats. These significant drawbacks outweigh the potential benefits, warranting a more cautious approach to their development and implementation. \n",

      "\n",
      "- **Substantial Reduction in Human Error**: A crucial step in enhancing road safety, especially with the increasing number of vehicles on the road.\n",
      "- **Valuable Time Optimization**: The potential to reclaim time spent driving for more productive or leisurely activities is invaluable in today's fast-paced world.\n",

      "-------------------\n",
      "Text2\n",
      "In general, many of the pros center on preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. Simply driving around any major city today would provide adequate proof of that. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This computer system would adjust to obstacles and always be on guard. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. The same human error and distractions mentioned earlier will be taken out of the equation by the vehicle and computer. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self-driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. Additionally, many people rely on ride sharing services as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. There is always a chance of damage or malfunction inherent in any computer operated system. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may affect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident? A question like that will take a lot of time to work out.\n",
      "\n",
      "With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self-driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self-driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out human errors is extremely important. With more and more cars being on the road today, there is a higher and higher chance to of being in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, or highly reduce the chances, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back. To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful. Overall, I believe that these benefits greatly outweigh the costs.\n",

Automation and artificial intelligence are the new buzzwords and implementation effort has been reduced drastically due to availability of high computing resources. Automobile industry too has been part of this automation wave and self driving cars is an example of the same. Driving in itself has been a passion for some, mundane task for others and extremely difficult for few. Recent improvements in road infrastructure has reduced the overall effort required in driving and self-driving cars can further eliminate this. Reduction in overall effort, more automation and safety can directly translate into more productivity and efficiency. Though we can see huge advantages of such automation, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles as we still need to address some important concerns and achieve perfection before we all are on the same page.\n",
      "\tBetter global economy, more international trade and cheap manufacturing labor lead to a boom in automobile industry. Developing countries where car was still considered a luxury 20 years ago is now an easy commodity to own. However, being born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, and it was always a challenge to drive in remote areas with uneven terrain and bad weather conditions. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the superpower known for its infrastructure and safety vehicles which are also linked as a symbol of personal freedom. One major concern is that developed countries like the United States cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars and we should consider tougher conditions even if we would only like to implement these vehicles in cities with good infrastructure. Success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such satellite service is still prone to errors and not available every at every remote location. GPS are also not very reliable to extreme weather conditions and can be a major hurdle in providing accuracy to self-driving cars. Mathematics and algorithms which are the backbone of this automation can still not achieve 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios. \n",
      "\tSelf-driving cars still need humans behind the wheel who are capable to operate sophisticated technology. Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology and specially true for many people in their middle and old age. Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction that can put the driver into more dangerous and complex situation than before. Even if we do achieve the scientific perfection, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is still tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. Overall cost involved in implementation, building perfect road infrastructure and training individuals surpass the expected utility of the complete program. \n",
      "\tReduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can be the reason for a major accident and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator behind the wheel (less of a driver) to understand this and can be unavoidable due to lack of manual control. Tough terrains, like mountains, where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of such malfunction. \n",
      "\tThe research idea behind implementation of self-driving cars is amazing, but is still at nascent stage and requires more research and development before it can be actually implemented as a real world solution. Multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs are still linked with the idea of implementation and we need to address each constraint individually.

      "In conclusion, while the concept of self-driving cars is innovative, its implementation is still in its infancy, necessitating further research and development to overcome constraints such as infrastructure, GPS reliability, weather conditions, financial viability, and safety concerns. Successful implementation may be more feasible in developed nations with controlled environments, but it remains a significant challenge for global adoption.\n",

      "Far too often, the media highlights devastating stories of innocent people killed in car accidents caused by drunk or distracted drivers. A proposed, yet contentious, solution is introducing self-driving cars on our roads. While numerous benefits exist, I remain opposed to their widespread adoption in society. \n",
      "\n",
      "The advantages of self-driving cars are clear: they significantly reduce human error, responsible for 81% of car accidents. This would lead to a decrease in minor accidents, such as rear-endings, as self-driving cars utilize algorithms to calculate optimal stopping distances. Additionally, as noted by Google's self-driving car program director, these vehicles are more courteous and defensive drivers than their human counterparts, fostering safer driving conditions for all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, self-driving cars would greatly benefit elderly and disabled individuals, enabling them to travel independently, as highlighted by The New York Times. The stress of parking would also diminish, as self-driving cars drop passengers off at their destination, resulting in fewer parking tickets and saved time. Moreover, \"platooning\" – electronic communication between self-driving cars – would reduce traffic congestion, allowing more vehicles on the road and potentially leading to higher speed limits and optimized gasoline usage. Overall, self-driving cars promise improved travel experiences with enhanced safety, reduced traffic, and time savings.\n",

      "Far too often, the media presents heart-wrenching stories of innocent people killed in car accidents from drunk or distracted drivers. Who would argue against a solution to these preventable problems? One proposed yet controversial solution is implementing self-driving cars on the roads. While many benefits exist, I still do not support their use in society. The benefits of self-driving cars are easily understood: they greatly reduce human error, which causes 81% of car accidents. The number of minor accidents like rear-endings would decrease because the computers of self-driving cars would use algorithms to calculate appropriate stopping distances. On the same note, as Google's director of their self-driving car program stated, self-driving cars are more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers. Better, more cautious drivers would lead to safer driving conditions for all parties. Furthermore, as The New York Times suggests, self-driving cars would greatly help elderly and disabled people travel. Self-driving cars would be of great use to those who cannot operate a vehicle. Plus, the stress of parking would decrease as self-driving cars drop passengers off at their destination. People would receive less parking tickets and save time on parking, making an overall easier travel experience. Additionally, self-driving cars would also reduce traffic congestion by electronically communicating in a process called “platooning” and enable more people to be on the road at once. The roads would greatly improve with steadier traffic and quicker travel times, with potentially higher speed limits. Other drivers could even maximize their gasoline usage. Overall, self-driving cars would offer people better travel with safer roads, less traffic, and time saved. However, self-driving cars pose many drawbacks. To begin, self-driving cars currently have a huge price tag of over $100,000, thereby diminishing the number of Americans able to buy one. Even if people do not purchase self-driving cars, the high cost to use them as a taxi would deter potential customers. Also, if self-driving cars do not become extremely widespread, they would not offer their maximum potential in preventing accidents and saving time and cost because they could not platoon together. Why would America use self-driving cars at all if these features would go to waste? Moreover, self-driving cars that rely on sensors, GPS devices, and traffic signals would malfunction if these other technology sources failed. Specifically, inclement weather impairs the sensor abilities of self-driving cars, putting people on the road during a storm at risk. Both passengers in self-driving cars and people driving next to them would feel anxious at the idea of the cars malfunctioning. With many places for technical errors, self-driving cars could be quite dangerous and daunting for all travelers. On a broader scale, ethical concerns would arise during a car accident with a human and self-driving car, leaving ambiguous blame toward the car itself and the car company. We must consider the potential legal implications and establish new ethical laws before we use self-driving cars. In short, America would not fully gain all of the benefits of self-driving cars unless more were on the road than human drivers, but this concept would not happen quickly due to high cost and people's hesitations. The transition phase of slowly adding self-driving cars would cause lingering tension on the road. While self-driving cars offer an efficient solution to multiple driving issues, they pose too big of a threat to incorporate into modern society.  At this time, since the perks do not outweigh the persistent cons, perhaps America is not ready for self-driving cars.\n",

      "Acknowledging that self-driving cars are not immune to accidents is crucial; potential risks include malfunctions, adverse weather conditions, and limitations in interpreting human traffic signals. However, these risks pale in comparison to the current dangers posed by human error, which, as noted, accounts for 81% of car accidents. By minimizing human error, self-driving cars could drastically decrease fatalities and injuries, thereby healing the wounds of countless families, schools, and communities.\n",

      "The cost-effectiveness of self-driving cars extends far beyond insurance and healthcare savings. These vehicles can coordinate to prevent and alleviate traffic congestion, leading to lower fuel expenses. Additionally, reallocating police resources, previously dedicated to road patrols, could enhance public safety. With the burden of driving lifted, individuals can utilize their time more productively during commutes, engaging in activities like reading, working, or communicating, potentially enabling longer, more convenient commutes.\n",

      "As technology advances rapidly, innovators are exploring self-driving cars, transforming a once-futuristic concept into a potential reality. While this innovation may evoke images of a Utopian society, its societal impact is multifaceted. Proponents often associate self-driving cars with unparalleled leisure, reduced stress, and fewer accidents due to the elimination of human error. However, this perspective overlooks the potential for human error in programming, algorithm miscalculations, and technological faults, which could mirror the risks associated with human drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of self-driving cars poses significant challenges that currently outweigh their benefits. A primary argument in their favor is the absence of distractions, but this overlooks the irreplicable human reactions and instincts. The misconception that self-driving cars can surpass human decision-making capabilities is misguided, as machines cannot fully replicate primal human judgment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a scenario where a self-driving car encounters a sudden obstacle, such as a shopping cart, with a pedestrian nearby. While algorithms might suggest swerving, a human could instinctively decide to prioritize the pedestrian's safety. This highlights the gap in judgment and instinct between humans and machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-world incidents, like the recent case of a self-driving car striking a pedestrian at night due to undetected emergence from a dark spot, underscore the vehicles' current developmental shortcomings. Moreover, in the era of cyber warfare, the susceptibility of self-driving car technology to hacking poses a formidable threat, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costs of implementing self-driving cars are prohibitively high, with estimated development costs around $100,000 per vehicle. This investment could be better allocated to pressing societal needs or medical research, which currently faces underfunding. For instance, redirecting these funds towards combating life-threatening diseases could potentially save millions of lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while self-driving cars may offer some benefits, they lack the nuanced decision-making and instinctual capabilities of humans.

      "As technology continues to progress at a rapid pace innovators have begun to explore the possibility of self-driving cars. A society with self-driving cars sounds like a child's response to the question \"What does the future look like\". Self-driving cars evoke fantastical thoughts of what a futuristic Utopian society looks like. However, self-driving cars are no longer a fantasy idea, and the impact that these vehicles may have on society is immense. To many in society, the term \"self-driving cars\" is synonymous with complete leisure . With a self-driving car there is no need to be stressed driving or road rage because something else is in charge of the wheel. There are notions that self-driving cars could help to limit accidents due to the fact that they take away the human error of driving. While somewhat naive, it is generally thought that these cars will be programmed to easily avoid accidents and obey all traffic laws. However, this is a very idealistic way of examining the situation. Self-driving cars still hold their fair share of negative consequences for society. While, on the surface, it may appear as though self-driving cars are eliminating the human error in driving they are simply replacing it with another opportunity for human error. There is still a strong possibility of human error in the actual programming of the vehicles. The algorithms could be miscalculated or the technology of the vehicle could be faulty, resulting in a similar high-risk potential to an average human driver. This, along with several other reasons, is why society would not benefit from the  continued push for the implementation of self-driving cars. \n",
      "\tThe risks of self-driving cars are currently too difficult to overcome when it comes to implementing them into society. One argument for self-driving cars is that they will not be distracted like human drivers can be since they will have an specific set of algorithms to follow while on the road. While it is true that human drivers face hundreds of distractions while driving they still have certain human reactions and instincts that cannot be replicated by a machine. One of the gravest misconceptions associated with these vehicles is that the decision-making aspects of a self-driving car is greater than that of an average human. However, this theory is ill-advised as a machine cannot recreate the enhanced and primal judgment of a human being. While those who produce these self-driving cars will attempt to ensure that their decision-making is on equal to a human being's, there is simply no way to completely and accurately replicate human instincts. Imagine, a scenario in which a self-driving car is cruising steadily down the road past a grocery store when suddenly a shopping cart comes directly into its path and it does not have enough time to stop. Algorithms would suggest that the car  swerve to avoid the shopping cart. But now imagine that there is a human being crossing the street parallel to the shopping cart. How will the self-driving car know that it would be better to brace the impact of the cart and hit that directly instead of the human. It is not clear that a self-driving car would posses the judgment and instincts to process that decision in a matter of milliseconds. On the other hand, a human would at least be capable of knowing making the conscious decision to avoid the human being. \n",
      "        A real-life example of how these self-driving cars may be unable to pick up on various signals outside of the vehicle is the incident that recently happened in the United States. A few months ago there was a self-driving car that struck a pedestrian at night. It was reported that the car did not recognize the pedestrian because they appeared out of a dark spot that the car's cameras did not pick up on. This lack of ability to pick up on stimuli and night show that these cars are not yet developed enough to be ushered into society. \n",
      "\tIn the age of cyber warfare it is also obvious that these self-driving cars pose a threat to possible hackers. The technology that is used in self-driving cars is susceptible to outside hackers who could interfere with the self-driving algorithms thus causing extremely dangerous conditions for drivers. Yes, there can be measures put in place to try and combat these hackers; however, there is no steadfast way to ensure the safety and security of this type of technology. It is terrifying to imagine the consequences that would result from self-driving cars being overrun by hackers and used in a form of cyber warfare. Motor vehicles are already viewed as possible weapons even when they are being controlled by innocent and responsible humans, but if these vehicles can easily be taken advantage of by outside hackers, who seek to cause harm, the risk would appear to be too great for society. \n",
      "\tThe costs of implementing self-driving cars into society would be extremely high and would not pose any direct benefits to society than what we already have. The amount of money that would go into developing these self-driving cars could go to several better causes and research opportunities. While it is true that we should invest in technological advancements, society needs to weigh the necessity of such inventions. A self-driving car is an expensive luxury that does not have a direct benefit on society as a whole. It is reported that the cost to implement such new technological advancements into self-driving cars is around $100,000. This is a significant amount of money that is going to a societal \"want\" rather than a societal \"need\". Self-driving cars are a futuristic luxury concept at best, and in the today's society there are much more noble and helpful causes that this money could go to. For instance, the money that would be spent on these self-driving cars could be better spent researching life threatening diseases and other issues that are a current threat to society. It has been reported that several medical research endeavors that have significant promise for the advancement of human health are being underfunded. The money that is being funneled into the development of self-driving cars is, in turn, taking funds away from possible medical advancements that could save millions of human lives. \n",
      "\tWhile these are only a handful scenarios of thousands, it is clear that self-driving cars lack the human instinct and decision-making that no form of algorithm can replicate. Self-driving cars also lack a necessity in society and the luxury of these items is not worth the potential toll they could have on society. With several unknowns and the high risks associated self-driving cars it is prudent and safest to avoid implementing self-driving cars into society as their various potential negative outcomes seem to significantly outweigh the benefits that they would have on society.\n",

The 33,000 fatalities per year caused by car accidents might be able to be reduced. However, self-driving cars present many technology barriers and potential disadvantages. Is it actually worth it to society to implement self-driving cars? \n",
      "\tThere are many benefits of self-driving cars. Humans are not perfect, but computers can be better than humans at one specified task – such as driving. Human error, especially from distractions at the wheel, causes 81% of car accidents, and use of computers will remove human error completely from the equation. In addition, computers can calculate when to stop, slow down or speed up, turn, and more, which is safer and more appropriate than a human’s quick guesstimation. Computers can also be programmed to always be defensive drivers; unlike people, who range from defensive to offensive in their driving styles. Because of this, self-driving cars would reduce accidents, resulting in reduced health and insurance costs for society. In addition, these calculations could improve traffic due to a behavior called platooning. This would allow people to have more time to do work or spend their time in more enjoyable ways while traveling instead of staring down a drab highway. As pointed out by a Forbes article, there is a cost savings associated with time, such as time spent driving. Lastly, suggested by the New York Times, self-driving cars could help disabled or elderly individuals get around. \n",
      "\tHowever, self-driving cars do have drawbacks. Humans would still need to know how to operate them, according to Teletrac, and the cost of implementation is high. Current estimations of costs of a self-driving car is more than $100,000, much more than what people spend today on a car. All of society would need to adopt the technology, and trust the technology, otherwise accidents would still occur with people still on the road. In addition, this technology would be at a high risk for hacking and data breaches, as noted by The Guardian, who claims that the nefarious hackers would be very interested in the technology. Self-driving cars could also eliminate transportation sector jobs, impacting the economy and increasing the unemployment rate. Finally, if an accident happened, who would be to blame - man or machine? And if an accident did happen, how would the cars interpret temporary human traffic signals? Would humans even know how to operate cars anymore, or would they be stuck until the cause of the accident is fixed? \n",
      "\tYes, there are many drawbacks to self-driving cars. This includes the obstacle of getting the technology to do what we want it to do, the bigger obstacle of implementing this large change into society and infrastructure, and risks of fully depending on technology for transportation.

      "When Back to the Future I and II were released in the 80's, many people were captivated by the technology showed throughout the films. Even though technology has greatly advanced within the last decade, it still has not reached the status of flying cars and floating hover boards. As we inch closer to 2020, the idea of having such technology does not seem impossible anymore. Olivier Garret stated in a Forbes article that he believed 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020, and one out of four cars will be self-driving by 2030. Although Back to the Future II predicted cars flying in 2015, the estimate of 2020 for self-driving cars is not that far off. \n",
      "\tWithin the past year, companies like Ford, Honda, BMW and Tesla are some of the automakers that are pushing for self-driving technology. This makes complete sense as technology is increasing forward and will continue to do so as long as there is a need for it. However, there are many drawbacks when implementing something so new and different. There is not a lot of previous data or research to consult with. If an error/accident occurs, it will be difficult to pinpoint the problem. It would be very hard to distinguish if the problem lies with individual car or if it encompasses all self-driving cars. Problems like this will eventually be answered, but it is going to take some time before it can be done efficiently. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages because technology is improving constantly, and there is a need for better transportation. The modes of transportation that are available now work decently, but can always be improved. As a result, society is better off by using self-driving cars because it provides more opportunities and resources that can help improve human life. \n",
      "\tThe best advantage of self-driving cars is to overall reduce human error. Human error is known to be a cause of major accidents, especially when a driver is trying to multi-task and focus on other things besides driving. Although it is easy to forget, the human brain is not a machine. It is an organ that responds uniquely to problems and can produce multiple solutions. A machine differs from the brain because it has a set algorithm programmed to provide an expected solution. There is no wrong solution as the only appropriate solution is already being used. Self-driving cars can help reduce accidents caused by humans since they do not have an inclination to be distracted. The machine has one job and it does it efficiently. As a result, drivers will no longer be distracted when multi-tasking. In addition to reducing human error, self-driving cars will provide more opportunities by providing transportation to those who cannot drive.  \n",
      "\tAll in all, technological advances are going to occur as we become smarter as a species. When technology advances too far too quickly, there can be some concerns about the quality of the product and its functionality.\n",
      "\tPotential problems/disadvantages of self-driving cars include an increased rate in unemployment. Driving instructors, DMV tellers and employees of companies like Uber and Lyft, will definitely suffer as there will be less of a demand for those services. Self-driving cars can complete tasks more safely and efficiently than humans. As self-driving cars increase, the amount of jobs available will decrease. Although this is an important concern, technology failure (i.e. glitches), would be an even greater problem. Accidents could be more fatal and insurance rates might increase to account for that. It would not be surprising if insurance companies came up with required coverage for autonomous cars. Instead of purchasing just a basic insurance plan, insurance companies would have the ability to raise the price however they want. Auto insurance companies already receive way too much money, but if there was a way to get two for the price of one, many people would be more likely to get a self-driving car. \n",
      "\tOverall, self-driving cars have many benefits and are an integral part of society. They can make the roads safer, provide more opportunities, and most importantly, save lives. As ambitious as it may be, having 10 million cars on the road by 2020 is not impossible and surprisingly, it might happen sooner than we think.\n",

      "The most notable advantages to self-driving cars are the elimination of human error and distracted driving, which cause a majority of car accidents; redistribution of the time people spend driving to other tasks, such as reading, chatting, and eating; and provision of a safe and independent mode of transportation for people with disabilities, elderly adults, and intoxicated individuals who may be unable to drive. However, security risks, exorbitant prices, and limited adaptation abilities provide compelling evidence against the case for self-driving cars. \n",
      "\tA large consideration, especially when considering technological advances, is the safety of our personal data as consumers. Hackers and large companies could gain an incredible amount of information through self-driving cars, and likely because of the newness of the technology, there are little to no security measures in place to protect us from these security threats, according to Egil Juliussen, the Director of Research for infotainment and advanced driver assistance for IHS Automotive. \n",
      "\tIn addition, because of the $100,000 cost, a widespread decrease in car accidents can never be attained. In order for self-driving cars to thrive and for us to experience their benefits, they must be the majority on the road, and based on the current socioeconomic climate in the United States, this will not be the case. The $100,000 price point includes sensors, software, engineering, and power and computer requirements, and it will likely be a major deterrent to people buying self-driving cars. \n",
      "\tMy final concern is the self-driving car's inability to adapt to situations such as traffic signal failures, inclement weather, and inaccurate GPS mapping. A simple solution is for a driver to enter a manual mode during scenarios such as these, but drivers may not respond quickly enough, particularly if they are using their newfound free time to eat, talk, or read. More dangerously, people with impairments due to age, ability, or intoxication may not be equipped to maneuver the vehicle. Lastly, in the case of GPS inaccuracy, which many users can attest to, a driver may not realize that their car is taking them in the wrong direction, turning down a one-way street, or avoiding a road that does not appear to exist in the data. \n",
      "\tOverall, the risks associated with self-driving cars eclipse the benefits. Despite the luxury of enjoying more free time or the promise of increased accessibility to owning and operating a vehicle, self-driving cars are not a reliable mode of transportation.

      "\tMany dystopian books and films would like you to believe that the steady integration of AI is the start of our societal downfall, but this is simply not the case--take self-driving cars for example. For those of you who are unfamiliar, self-driving cars are vehicles that rely on AI to give itself directions and to literally drive itself without any human interaction. \n",
      "\tIn general, this is a great improvement to driving safety as it can provide a much secure form of driving. Humans are easily fallible--they get distracted, they get sleepy, and they can choose to drive while under the influence--which can drastically increases the chance of accidents. Computers, however, are literally unable to succumb to such mistakes and are therefore safer. \n",
      "\tAdditionally, computers are able to communicate with other computers easily, unlike humans who have no form of communication with any of the other drivers in close proximity. This advantage allows computers in self-driving cars to sense each other within seconds and negotiate the road together. \n",
      "\tHowever, many people think that if we were to rely on these AI-driven cars, it would become a gradual demise for us. Self-driving cars are hackable. They can be fooled. And they rely on people en masse to \"opt-in\" and buy their own self-driving cars, otherwise a single self-driving car cannot communicate with a vehicle which cannot \"talk back.\"\n",
      "\tBut what these naysayers are forgetting is that all of these downfalls can be remedied with time--we are only seeing the beginning of this new stage in automation. It is a natural process to introduce new technology into society and wait for newer models to come out until it is perfected. By dismissing the new technology in its early stages without giving it the chance to improve with time would be like telling a child to stop practicing at something because they were awful in the beginning. \n",
      "\tHere is a simple example of how we can slowly rely on technology to assist us: traffic lights. Way before we relied on traffic lights to help guide us through intersections, we had traffic guards to help us. But over time, we allowed ourselves to accept traffic lights, instead of a human, to help us through. And of course, the traffic light wasn't perfect or even similar to the version we have today! It also had a simpler code and fewer systems to help us, but we let it stay up and now we have near-perfect traffic light controls and coordination systems. \n",

This is not to say that the negative points aren't valid or accurate observations on the current self-driving cars we have today. But we tend to forget that this is not an indication of what it could be. Of what it could provide for us. And how helpful and much safer it could actually be for us in the long-term. \n",

Will improve upon its spatial awareness and its adaptability in order for the programs to be fooled as easily. And with further improvement, the more common the technology will become and cause its pricepoint to decrease, which in turn will make self-driving cars much more accessible and allow a wider population to purchase their own.\n",
      "\tThere is also the concern about the start of a dystopian-like society. \"What if we become too reliant on our technology, and then it decides to just stop working or turn against us?\" To that, I say: science-fiction is still science-fiction. Just because we learned how to use a calculator does not mean we have stopped learning mathematics in school. Just because we have the autopilot feature in planes does not mean we do not stop teaching pilots how to fly. And just because we give cars the knowledge of the road does not mean that all of a sudden it is going to drive off without us.\n",

Not only would they be fuel efficient and reduce the number of accidents on the road, it would also allow the driver the opportunity to interact with their friends in the car instead of focusing on the road. Transportation by car would instead be similar to a train where you can leisurely admire the view and chat with friends while you cruise towards the destination. However, self driving cars are not infallible. Leaving our lives to the decisions of a machine is no simple task. Should the technology  fail, will the drivers who lack practice be able to handle the situation. Being suddenly thrown into such a situation would cause the driver to panic and be more prone to causing accidents. Overall, until this technology proves to be almost fail proof, it will most likely not be widely accepted or implemented. In the following paragraph I will be explaining why it is a good stepping stone to the future. \n",
      "\tSelf driving cars are the way to the future. It would greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road. Over 90 percent of road accidents are attributed to human error, by employing self driving cars, we will eliminate the human error which is the key cause of many road accidents that occur today. By taking the human out of driving, there will be less chances of misjudgments because a machine does what it is programmed. \n",

The GPS which we often use today to get to our destination are not very reliable. One example of its unreliability is whenever there are overlapping roads, the GPS is unable to identify which road we are on and would give conflicting instructions. Furthermore, GPS do not work underground and in tunnels, affecting available routes of self driving cars. The inaccuracy of the device could lead to inefficiencies and longer travelling times to accommodate the restrictions and issues mentioned above. The weather itself could also hamper the accuracy of the GPS, disrupting the performance of the self driving car. With so many disruptions and inaccuracies, self driving cars would not be able to operate efficiently and thus may perform worse than simply driving the car.  \n",
      "\tIn order to counter the above problem, some may suggest that we use more sophisticated and accurate instruments in our vehicles. However, these technologies would cause the cost of purchasing these car to be astronomical. This would limit the number of self driving cars on the road and affect the accuracy of driving as self driving cars rely upon information provided by other self driving cars. With less information about its surrounding vehicles, it will not be able to accurately judge the situation and thus result in poorer performance. This is a major issue as not only are we paying highly for such a product, but also the product fails to meet the expectations of the user.

Some may argue that these self driving cars are much safer than our current modes of transportation. I hold with the opinion that these cars would not be more beneficial because they would occur with significantly higher costs than those of human driven cars. \n",
      "\tIt has been shown that upwards of 33,000 people die annually from car accidents, and many people believe that these self driving cars can be the resolution. Car accidents are often caused by human error, like distractions. Many people in support of self driving cars may argue that since these cars are ran by computers, they are unable to become distracted, significantly lowering the probability of fatal car accidents. These cars are ran by complex algorithms that allow the car to be aware of its surroundings. These algorithms would allow for the cars to know the locations of stop lights, as well as distances between itself and other cars on the road. It is proposed that the value of a human life is around 9.2 million dollars, and with a decrease in fatal car accidents, a significant decrease in health care and insurance costs would follow if self driving cars were used regularly. \n",

Firstly, although these cars would decrease the occurrence of human error, they can still be accompanied with significantly high amounts of  human error. With these errors, fatal accidents can, and most definitely will happen if self driven cars are made the norm. These self driven cars are also unsafe because they pose a threat to personal security. These cars are operated on computer programming and software, which can be open to hackers that could collect personal information from the passengers.\n",

      "There has been much discussion on the topic of self driving cars recently. Many people think that allowing self driving cars on the road would be a bad idea. They worry about things such as liability in case of accidents, and loss of jobs for truck drivers and others employed in the automotive industry. However, self driving cars are the way of the future; the pros of having self driving cars on the road vastly outweigh the cons. The effects of self driving cars will benefit society in a multitude of ways, and will allow mankind to advance further in technology and science alike. \n",
      "\tThere are many ways the advent of self driving cars will be beneficial to mankind. For example, people can get easily distracted while driving, which is one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents in the United States as of today. However it is not possible for a computer to become distracted, it does not have personality or curiosity like humans do; thus, if computers controlled the wheel, accidents on the road would decline greatly. This has more implications than just saving human life, there would be a significant fiscal advantage as well. Right now there is 9.2 million dollars saved for motor vehicle accidents, however if the roads became safer, then less of this money would need to be allocated for accidents and could be used in other areas. Additionally, many cars even have features that resemble early stages of self driving cars; most cars have object sensors, autonomous breaking, and many other driver-less car like features. Consequently, the step to fully autonomous cars is not actually as big as some critics may believe. As seen by these few examples, self driving cars have immense potential to help society, and therefore we should be more open to release them in public. \n",
      "\tEven with all of the benefits that self driving cars have to offer, there are still some critiques. For example, people worry that passengers may not have the skills needed to operate cars (why would you learn how to drive a car if it drove itself?), and if there was a glitch, it may turn into a serious issue. However, there could easily be regulations enacted that would require drivers to take a test every year or so, to ensure that they can take over in the case of an emergency. Just as drivers have to prove they can drive a car today, they would have to do the same in the future. Another common concern is the cars driving ability in hazardous weather conditions. Some sensors can be notably damaged by heavy rain and wind. This concern is not as serious as it may seem however. If there was regulation passed to make sure humans still knew how to drive, than they could just take over during inclement weather. Furthermore, if the weather conditions were that dangerous, than it would not be advisable to go driving anyway! Though people may have concerns about the effects of self driving cars on society, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will harm.\n",
      "I imagine a future where kids can play outside safely, without worrying about a ball rolling onto a busy street, a world where parents did not have to fear that their newly initiated teenage driver would make it to his friend in one piece, and a place that has enough money to upkeep public transportation and roads. This world that I imagine, and that I hope you imagine too, can come as a direct followup from self driving cars. Self driving cars are not perfect yet, and there are still many issues to be worked out. Despite this, I believe that with all the potential benefits that self driving cars can bring to society, they should be not only adopted, but embraced. They can help with many different aspects of society, but only if we let them.\n",

      "There has been intense debate recently surrounding the implementation of self-driving cars on public roads. While concerns about liability, job loss for truck drivers, and automotive industry employees are valid, the benefits of self-driving cars far outweigh these drawbacks. The integration of self-driving cars will have a profoundly positive impact on society, driving technological and scientific advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "One significant advantage of self-driving cars is the drastic reduction in motor vehicle accidents, primarily caused by human distraction. Unlike humans, computers are immune to distraction, lacking personality and curiosity. This would lead to a substantial decrease in accidents, saving countless lives and allocating the current $9.2 million reserved for motor vehicle accidents to other vital areas. Moreover, many modern cars already feature preliminary self-driving technologies, such as object sensors and autonomous braking, making the transition to fully autonomous vehicles less daunting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the potential benefits, concerns persist. Critics worry about passengers' ability to operate vehicles in case of glitches or emergencies. Implementing annual driving tests to ensure competence would easily mitigate this issue, mirroring current licensing requirements. Another concern is the vehicles' performance in hazardous weather conditions, which could damage sensors. However, with regulations in place for human intervention during such conditions, and considering the inadvisability of driving in extreme weather, this concern is manageable.\n",

      "Envisioning a future with self-driving cars, we see a world where children can play safely, parents worry less about their teenagers' driving, and public transportation and roads receive adequate funding. Although self-driving cars are not yet perfect, with many issues still to be resolved, their potential benefits to society are undeniable. I firmly believe that self-driving cars should not only be adopted but also embraced, as they hold the key to positively transforming various aspects of our society, if we allow them to.@\n",

      "This article on self driving cars was interesting because it introduced arguments that I hadn't considered before. Obviously, self driving cars would help decrease the number of accidents that are caused purely by human error. However, now we face the uncharted territory of vehicular accidents caused by mechanical error. Automobile accidents cause thousands of premature deaths every year in our country.  From distracted driving to driving under the influence, public health officials lead several efforts to encourage safe driving in attempt to decrease accidents.  However, with the development of new technology, some wonder if the use of self driving cars would aid in the decrease of automobile accidents.  When reading the article, I was able to empathize with both sides of the argument.\n",
      "\tOne of the arguments in favor of self driving cars would be that they can help decrease the number of accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. There are many heart breaking stories of death or serious injury resulting from persons under the influence getting behind the wheel. The development, popularity and affordability of Uber and Lyft has made getting around easier.  They are widely used by people that have been out drinking and are not able to drive home.  However, we still have the problem of intoxicated driving in our country.  The article believes that the development of self driving cars would help decrease the number of accidents caused by drunk drivers.  I can agree with this prediction.  Even though Uber and Lyft are usually reasonably priced, there may be people that are confident in their driving abilities and do not want to pay someone else to drive them.  Potentially, self driving cars would enable these people to get home safer because they would not be responsible for operating the vehicle.  In a perfect world, I believe that self driving cars could be a great solution to decreasing the number of automobile accidents in our country.  However, there is a lot of work that needs to happen before we praise the use of self driving cars. \n",
      "\tI feel that the most complicated issue in regards to self driving cars was the issue of who to blame when can accident inevitably occurs. If a child runs out in front of a car and the car cannot detect it quickly enough and does not stop, who is at fault? I believe that many people would wonder if the accident could have been prevented if a human was behind the wheel. Would they have been able see the child out of their periphery and anticipate the child might run towards the road? Perhaps the accident could have been prevented. To add to this predicament, there will be people attempting to blame to manufacturer for visibility issues. Others may argue that the driver should have been paying attention to the road, even if they own a self driving car. I believe that there would need to be concrete rules about how active of a role the driver needs to play. Should the driver still be 100% focused on the road? This would be the optimal scenario for increasing safety because the human and the car would essentially be working together.  However, if this is the case, then it would negate the positive discussed in the preceding paragraph because drunk drivers would still not be allowed to operate the vehicle.\n",
      "\tFrom reading this article, I would have to say that, while self driving cars come with benefits,  I do not think we should work on replacing humans drivers entirely. I think that if the purpose is to make driving safer and minimize accidents, then drivers should also be 100% attentive to the road. Driving and traffic conditions are too complicated to leave to just a robot. There  are many last minute decisions that humans need to make that can save lives. A self driving car could provide too much comfort to drivers and perhaps lead to them being less cautious. A false sense of safety behind the wheel is extremely dangerous. I think that even with self driving cars, drivers should be held responsible for any accidents (unless there is a true manufacturing error that causes the accident) because I believe that the responsibility still falls on the human to operate the vehicle safely. I believe that the introduction of self driving cars would lead to confusion and frustration before it leads to the positive changes we want to observe.  Therefore, we should proceed cautiously while we continue to collect research and develop training methodologies for proper vehicle operations.\n",

A key benefit of self-driving cars is their potential to decrease accidents caused by human error, which currently claim thousands of lives annually in our country. Despite efforts to promote safe driving, mechanical errors now pose a new concern. Here, I weigh both sides of the debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A Pro: Reducing Accidents Caused by Intoxicated Drivers**\n",
      "Self-driving cars could mitigate accidents involving drunk drivers, a persistent issue despite the rise of Uber and Lyft. Some individuals, confident in their driving abilities, might still drive under the influence, risking lives. Self-driving cars could provide a safer alternative for these individuals, assuming they would utilize the technology. In theory, this could decrease accident rates, but significant development and testing are needed before embracing self-driving cars as a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A Con: The Complexity of Assigning Blame**\n",
      "A crucial concern with self-driving cars is determining liability in the event of an accident. If a child unexpectedly runs in front of a self-driving car that fails to stop, who is at fault? Would a human driver have prevented the accident through peripheral vision or anticipation? This dilemma raises questions about the driver's role in a self-driving vehicle. Should they remain fully attentive, essentially working in tandem with the car for optimal safety? If so, this negates the benefit for drunk drivers, as they would still be unable to operate the vehicle safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A Balanced Perspective**\n",
      "After considering the arguments, I believe we should not entirely replace human drivers with self-driving cars. To enhance safety and minimize accidents, drivers should remain 100% attentive. Driving conditions are too complex to rely solely on automation, requiring humans to make crucial, split-second decisions. Self-driving cars might induce a false sense of security, leading to decreased caution. Therefore, unless a manufacturing defect is the direct cause, drivers should be held accountable for accidents. The introduction of self-driving cars will likely lead to initial confusion and frustration. Consequently, we should proceed with caution, continuing to gather research and develop training methodologies for safe vehicle operation.\n",

      "The name, Self-Driving Car, in itself elicits advantages, but then also fear and therefore some disadvantages. The new technology's most important advantage is increasing the time that cars can drive close together while maintaining flowing traffic. The sensor, then, is more reliable than the human when judging the minimum distance cars can drive safely on the road together. This is because the sensor is objective and not distracted, while the human is subjective and distracted.The program determines the safe minimum distance and then as a result, more cars can be on the road at the same time without having slow car flow or slow traffic. As experience shows, sometimes humans misestimate the safe minimum distance and this can lead to wasted space on the road or car crashes. One can then see that not only can the roads be more efficient for travel, but also reduction in car crashes can make the roads less dangerous. \n",
      "\tAs mentioned before, the name, Self-Driving Cars, can also elicit fearer. One such fearer is the gasoline industry. Many in this field may reason that if the self-driving car is electric, the demand for gasoline will decline. Those who reason as such are not far from the truth. If there is less of a demand for gasoline fuel, these industries are indeed at risk for reduction in their net profit. Unfortunately, for advocates of the gasoline industry, the imagery of “new and improved” does include electricity as the new and improved from gasoline fuel. Many might come to recognize that electricity power is a form of “new and improved” because it is friendlier for the environment than “gasoline fuel.” \n",
      "\tIf one has lived long enough, one can recognize the value of good relationships not just with other people but also with the environment. It almost relates to the nature vs. nurture debate. Social and environmental factors determine our personalities. This opinion is important because Self-driving cars are beneficial to society because they improve the quality of environmental factors. In other words, Self-driving cars make the air “healthier” by reducing the carbon dioxide content. If there is more oxygen with which our bodies can produce energy, then in the long-term the people in this environment can have healthier states of homeostasis. For example, the reference paper argued that Self-driving cars would reduce the time that cars on the road. The fewer moments that cars are on the road lead to fewer turns of the energy cycle and then fewer instances of energy that is lost as heat or waste. This then can render the air more free of waste over time, and the people using the air healthier. \n",
      "\tFinally, the increased frequency of an electric power source for electric cars and a diminished frequency of a \"dirty\" gasoline power source for normal cars would make the environment cleaner. Not only does the fuel affect air’s cleanliness but also land’s cleanliness. For example, I have mistakenly spilled gas on the floor while refueling my vehicle. An adjacent fire could make this \"careless” mistake into a great fire. This fire would affect land’s cleanliness. An unclean land can affect the inhabitants of the land. Self-driving cars can help prevent such incidents that can make the land unclean. A cleaner land and air can make the people healthier. Therefore, “Self driving cars” can help move society forward to better health. \n",
      "\tFor the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several societal advantages to start sprouting, and one of those advantages is better health.\n",

      "\n",
      "The term \"Self-Driving Car\" inherently conveys both benefits and concerns. A primary advantage of this technology is its potential to increase traffic flow by safely reducing the distance between vehicles. Unlike humans, who are prone to subjective judgments and distractions, the sensor system objectively determines the minimum safe distance, enabling more cars to share the road without compromising traffic flow. This not only enhances travel efficiency but also reduces the risk of accidents, often caused by human misjudgments of safe distances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the advent of Self-Driving Cars, particularly if electric, sparks fear within the gasoline industry. A decrease in gasoline demand could indeed threaten the industry's profitability. However, the shift towards electricity aligns with the broader societal move towards environmental sustainability, recognizing electricity as a more eco-friendly alternative to gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long-term benefits of Self-Driving Cars extend to environmental quality, which in turn, positively impacts human health. By reducing time spent on the road, these vehicles decrease energy consumption, minimizing heat waste and lowering carbon dioxide emissions. This leads to cleaner air, which is crucial for maintaining healthier states of homeostasis in individuals. Furthermore, the transition from gasoline to electric power sources not only purifies the air but also protects land from potential pollution, such as oil spills, thereby safeguarding the well-being of inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the integration of Self-Driving Cars can significantly contribute to a cleaner environment, which is pivotal for the health and well-being of society. For these reasons, I firmly believe that Self-Driving Cars will usher in numerous societal benefits, paramount among them being improved public health.@\n",

      "\tThere are many factors that influence our decisions when driving – how much rest we have had the night prior, the extraneous things we have on our minds that cause our attention to falter, and unfortunately, perhaps even the amount of alcohol we have consumed, if we are not making responsible decisions. \n",
      "\tDespite the distractions that accompany traditional driving, I believe that we should not popularize self-driven cars in our society as it will promote a lack of mindfulness while traveling, it will eliminate many jobs in transportation, and it is vulnerable to weather conditions. \n",
      "\tUtilizing self-driven cars would mean that the passenger does not have to pay attention while in the car, because the directions and destination are already mapped out for you. We are so busy in our everyday lives that we try to find methods to multi-task in any way possible. This engenders a lack of self-awareness and a lack of attention to the world around us. It is important to be present in all aspects of our lives; this should be especially true when on the road. That being said, self-driving cars could promote reckless behavior or mindlessness, as the driver would know they would not be responsible for driving home. \n",
      "\tFurther, self-driven cars would eliminate many jobs, like those who work for public authority, Uber, Lyft, or for taxi companies. This, in turn, could negatively affect our economy and leave many individuals without a means of income. Because car insurance would likely become extinct, insurance companies would also fail to thrive. Today, there is great need for individuals to work for transportation companies, as Uber and Lyft have become popularized by the convenience they provide. We should continue these services as they support those who perform the jobs as they remain an easy and convenient way to travel without driving yourself. \n",
      "\tWith eighty-one percent of car crashes being due to human error, the idea to use computers to operate cars appears to be a salient decision. As the article illuminates, there are “no opportunities for a computer to be ‘distracted’. Yet, computers, like humans, have the propensity to make mistakes. Although self-driving cars may be “more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers,” a self-driving car does not eliminate the likelihood of a car accident. There are many confounding variables to consider when thinking about individuals using self-driving cars: the weather, other traditional cars and their drivers, and the possibility of inappropriate - or developmentally-inappropriate persons - like children, mistakenly climbing behind the wheel. In these cases of an emergency, passengers of the self-driving car may be too overwhelmed or unable to respond in order to safely redirect the car. \n",
      "\tIn support of self-driven cars, however, is the way in which self-driving cars would support individuals with disabilities who rely on public transportation in order to travel. I believe this would be an accommodation that would make many destinations more accessible for those who could not drive themselves. Moreover, self-driven cars would be beneficial for the environment, as they would be electric and would not require gasoline to operate, which would, in turn would save users money as well. \n",
      "\tDespite the innovative benefits of self-driving cars, I am wary of the notion of automatic cars and would not partake in purchasing one. To me, there is something very calming and enjoyable about driving, and I believe that many people feel the same way. To me, introducing self-driving cars has the potential to promote poor behavior, to remove the need for transportation services, and could be fickle depending on weather and circumstance. Ultimately, I believe that the responsibility of the individual is to make informed decisions when driving in order to protect themselves and others while on the road. We should not rely on others – or vehicles -- to make those decisions for us.\n",

Self-Driving cars aim to solve this problem—putting the roadways firmly in the hands of advanced systems, safely and securely controlling and regulating travel with every turn of the wheel, push of the break, and touch of the pedal.

      "Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and democratizing commuting. On the other hand, the technology also raises a number of concerns, e.g. security, safety, and economy. \n",
      "\tIn my opinion, I support self-driving cars because the technology will have positive impacts on the society. First, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it eliminates deadly mistakes made by a human, such as driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tiredness). Moreover, drivers tend to have a false confidence over time, which will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Second, when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Consequently, we can save the cost of gas and our traveling time. Last but not least, self-driving cars democratize commuting and put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, they only operate on a pre-designated route and stop at particular locations (e.g. bus stops) rather than the travelers' desired destinations (e.g. a coffee shop on a small street) and schedules (e.g. after midnight). Furthermore, self-driving cars also provide private space for the travelers while in public transportations the travelers must share the space with many strangers. \n",
      "\tSelf-driving cars also have shortcomings but I think we can address them in a near future. These shortcomings can be categorized into two groups: the not-ready and the not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments of new challenges of the technology that our society has not addressed, e.g. legal responsibility and security. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? What would car-makers or software designers handle moral-sensitive situations? For example, which choice should be made by the self-driving car given an unavoidable accident killing either an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement? Security is another critical issue, such as how can drivers protect their personal data or even the self-driving cars if the vehicles are hacked? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. On the other hand, the not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology, e.g. human drivers' skills, different traffic regulations, interpreting police officers' signals, or the labor force. For example, there are concerns that drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuff. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. Another false opinion is the traffic regulation differences between states, e.g. turning right on red or not. In fact, cars can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on the GPS signal. They said that cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. However, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, police officers do not bother going down the streets to control the traffic. The officers just send information to the cars through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars and this will affect the labor force. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs to be manufactured. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more. These false assumptions will disappear when self-driving cars are deployed in the mass.\n",
      "\tIn conclusion, I think self-driving car is a revolution, of which advantages will outweigh shortcomings, and brings positive impact to the society. I am excited to wait for the time that the technology will be complete and deployed to everyone.\n",

      "Self-driving cars have sparked intense debates recently, with both enthusiastic supporters and concerned critics. While acknowledging the technology's drawbacks, I firmly believe that its benefits will ultimately transform society for the better. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Enhanced Safety and Efficiency**: Self-driving cars minimize the risk of accidents caused by human errors, such as driving under the influence or fatigue. Moreover, as they communicate with each other, they can optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and saving commuters time and fuel costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Democratizing Mobility**: Self-driving cars provide unparalleled accessibility for people with difficulties traveling, including the elderly and those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which is limited by fixed routes and schedules, self-driving cars offer door-to-door service and private travel spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Addressing Shortcomings**: The challenges facing self-driving cars can be categorized into 'not-ready' and 'not-true' concerns. **Not-ready** challenges, including legal responsibility, security, and moral dilemma resolutions, must be proactively addressed through legislation, robust cybersecurity measures, and transparent ethical guidelines before mass deployment. **Not-true** assumptions, such as concerns over driver skill obsolescence, traffic regulation complexities, interpreting police signals, and labor force impacts, are misconceptions that will dissipate as the technology advances and integrates into society. For instance, cars can update their algorithms based on GPS locations to adhere to local traffic laws, and the shift to self-driving will likely create new manufacturing and service jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: In conclusion, the transformative potential of self-driving cars, including enhanced safety, increased efficiency, and democratized mobility, outweighs its challenges. With proactive addressing of the technology's shortcomings, I eagerly anticipate the positive societal impact of self-driving cars upon their widespread adoption. \n",

      "The potential benefits of self-driving cars mentioned in the Auto Insurance Center article, \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated with Self-Driving Cars,\" are significant: no need for a driving license, reduction of distracted driving, and more time for other activities while in the car. However, those benefits assume the car would be in control 100% of the time, which is not realistic. Operators need to be aware and prepared to take control in the event of an emergency. Without more conversation about the education that drivers would need to have to successfully operate self-driving cars and more research into privacy and safety, driver-less cars will not be as beneficial as some might think. \n",
      "\tThe article lists not needing to get a driving license as an advantage of self-driving cars, but that license is still necessary. Sources including Teletrac note that drivers would still have to be trained in how to properly operate the vehicle in self-driving mode. The article also makes the point that over-relying on technology could mean that drivers would no longer have the skills to override the system and manually control the vehicle in the event of a failure. Thus, self-driving cars actually require more education: both standard self-driving car operating procedures as well as regular driving training. A potential benefit mentioned in the article is that people who can't normally operate cars--those who are disabled, elderly, or intoxicated--could operate a self-driving car, but even if trained on how to properly operate a self-driving car, these individuals may not have the  capacity to manually drive the vehicle if a technological failure requires immediate human intervention. Concerning, the article says, \"when a computer takes over the driving responsibilities, drivers can use that time to [...] catch up on reading [...] without having to worry too much about road safety.\" Not having to worry \"too much\" could put operators in a dangerous position should they need to take over should a system fail. Therefore, benefits--such as reduction of distracted driving and time in the car for other activities--have their limits, as drivers will need to be paying enough attention to take over in an emergency situation. \n",
      "\tEven if operators were given the necessary education to enjoy those benefits to some degree, there remains \n",
      "a second major concern: safety and privacy. The articles mentions several features that would help with safety, such as reducing human error and determining appropriate stopping distances. However, it also mentions that hacking is a safety concern for many reporting sources, including the Guardian. In 2016, seemingly harmless Internet connected devices such as refrigerators were used to crash major websites such as Twitter and Amazon. If that large scale of an attack can happen with simple devices, there is obvious reason for concern about having a car connected to the Internet that could be remotely manipulated into driving dangerously. In addition to physical safety concerns, the car would have a plethora of personal data on the operators' movements. The article supports this by saying that people are \"concerned about the opportunity for a computer build into the self-driving car to collect personal data.\" Personal safety and privacy are non-negotiable requirements of a successful self-driving car initiative.\n",
      "\tThe technology to protect citizens' personal data and physical well-being has not caught up with the technology of the self-driving cars. Although self-driving cars have many benefits, alert, educated operators still have to be ready to take over in an emergency, negating those advantages.\n",

      "The article \"Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated with Self-Driving Cars\" by the Auto Insurance Center highlights significant potential benefits, including the elimination of driving licenses, reduction of distracted driving, and increased productivity during travel. However, these advantages rely on unrealistic assumptions of 100% autonomous control. In reality, operators must remain vigilant and prepared to intervene in emergencies. To fully harness the benefits of self-driving cars, there is a pressing need for in-depth discussions on operator education and rigorous research into privacy and safety concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the article's suggestion, a driving license may still be necessary, as emphasized by sources like Teletrac, which note that drivers require training to operate vehicles in self-driving mode effectively. Over-reliance on technology could erode drivers' ability to manually override the system in case of failure, indicating that self-driving cars actually demand more comprehensive education, encompassing both standard operating procedures and regular driving skills. While self-driving cars could empower individuals with disabilities, elderly, or intoxicated persons to operate vehicles, their capacity to intervene manually in technological failures remains a concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article's point about utilizing travel time for other activities, assuming reduced worry about road safety, is misleading. Operators must remain attentive to take over in emergency situations, thus limiting the benefits of reduced distracted driving and increased leisure time in the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the need for operator education, two critical concerns persist: safety and privacy. Although the article mentions safety features like reducing human error, the risk of hacking, as reported by sources like The Guardian, poses a significant threat. The 2016 large-scale attack on websites like Twitter and Amazon using internet-connected devices underscores the vulnerability of internet-linked vehicles to remote manipulation. Additionally, self-driving cars would accumulate extensive personal data on operators, raising non-negotiable concerns about physical and data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the technology safeguarding citizens' personal data and physical well-being lags behind the advancements in self-driving car technology. While self-driving cars offer numerous benefits, the necessity for alert, educated operators to be ready to intervene in emergencies undermines these advantages, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to their development and implementation. \n",

      "Self-driving cars, though only recently having become a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development, managing to thoroughly capture the public eye. A debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole has been raging onward with impassioned arguments on both sides. In this essay I aim to provide convincing evidence that, though they have potential to cause societal harm, given the distressing array of negative societal impacts associated with human-driven cars, the apparent feasibility for self-driving cars to ameliorate these issues makes it only rational to welcome their implementation. \n",
      "\tTo start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these, it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. \n",
      "\tWhile no one would rightly argue that our current system is ideal, skepticism toward self-driving cars at this stage is more than fair. The development of the vehicles is very much still in its developmental infancy. Coupling that fact with the reality of a mixed automotive environment - with both computerized and human driven cars - one might very well expect implementation of self-driving cars to cause an increase in accidents. The key question then becomes: \"would a self-driving car actually be any safer than a human-driven one?\". While there is currently insufficient information to give a definite answer, I think there are good reasons to put more faith in the self-driving cars. Whereas human drivers tend to fall into a lull of false confidence after driving for many years, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. Further, there is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. In the absence of such risks, a computerized car might very well behave safer even without the ability to intuitively grasp tendencies and perceptions of neighboring human drivers. \n",
      "\tOthers however, are more concerned about the societal impact of these cars than their safety specs. Even if the change means less lives lost on the road, it still may be an unwise one if it leads to the ruin of lives off the road. Given the number of transportation jobs, a computerized revolution could displace the occupations of many currently employed drivers. Furthermore, given the massive economic investment needed to own such a car, might this lead to a widening of already egregious inequality gaps in the country? \n",
      "\tThe transportation industry represents a real threat if we have no place for the newly unemployed to turn. This however, is not a problem unique to self-driving cars but rather, is a pervasive and imminent threat encroaching on us from all directions given the rapid advance of technological competency. If we cannot, as a society solve this more generally, the threats will be realized even in the absence of the driver-less car revolution; if we do find a way to support the displaced workers of other sectors I remain hopeful that such approaches can be implemented to the transportation-sector as well. \n",
      "\tAs for societal inequality, self-driving vehicles, if implemented properly, could actually be a great boon to economically struggling classes. To begin, the previously considered transportation industry automation, though bad for workers, could be fantastic for commodity prices. If the cost of all daily goods dropped, many would be the better for it. Further, current systems of public transportation are woefully insufficient to serve their desired societal role. When jobs, hospitals, and enrichment events are inconvenient to access, attendance from under serviced individuals tends to drop. This creates a de-facto restriction on who may access what. With an automated public transportation system, it could be much easier to introduce flexible pick-up locations, drop-off spots, and schedules. With a more functional and convenient public transportation system, we could relieve both the economic burden of buying a vehicle as well as the logistical burden of navigating tricky and time-consuming bus routes. \n",
      "\tA society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine whether those differences were successes or failures. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it is reasonable to maintain optimism about the ability of self-driving cars to bring about dramatic improvements to our lives.\n",

      "1. **Dynamic situational awareness**: The ability to navigate complex, shared spaces with other road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.\n",

The loss of human agency and collective problem-solving capacity is a worrying aspect of our increasing reliance on machines.

All this makes me deeply empathetic toward seniors and the disabled who may not be able to drive, and for their sake, I can appreciate the value of a self-driven vehicle. \n",
      "\tMoreover, since self-driven cars are likely to be electric, they could mean the end of our reliance on fossil fuels,  something doubtless to be desired by all of us who worry about the future of our polluted planet. \n",

      "\tWe seem happy to cede increasing portions of our lives to computers. Where computers are absolutely better than us, e.g. in the analysis of large quantities of crucial data, say health-related  data, there can be no quarrel with their exclusive use. But I fear we may be in danger of losing too many of our everyday skills to them. Driving is a case in point. \n",
      "\tYou may ask what is so valuable about this skill. And I grant that for many, driving is routine, perhaps even tedious. Even so, there is a whole parcel of skills that are ancillary to driving per se. I mean the ability to be attentive and alert in a dynamic situation, the ability to be with others and jointly negotiate traffic so that all who use the streets, including cyclists and pedestrians, are safe and minimally inconvenienced. In our increasingly atomized world, these are not skills and capacities we can afford to lose. More is at stake than we might imagine. \n",
      "          Some claim that self-driven cars would obviate the need for public transportation, seeing this as something to recommend them. I disagree. Apart from the jobs lost, which I think most would see as a negative, there is the potential loss of public space, which after all, is what a bus, a subway car, or a train is. Like cities, where they are most in demand, forms of public transportation make for chance encounters with others whom we may otherwise never encounter. Cities, especially the larger ones, are rich in human variety, and one way to ensure that we limit our contact with this enriching variety is to sequester us in our individual self-driven vehicles. Sequestration of a sort is already far advanced. Most of us walk around mesmerized by screens and tuned in to our own individual soundscapes delivered via headphone. At home, this pattern of behavior continues, sadly. We are losing the ability to be with each other, whether that means having rich and complex and spontaneous interactions or simply occupying the same space, something that is not as mindless and mundane and trivial as it might appear, as psychologists and neuroscientists are beginning to understand. Self-driven cars, by eliminating the need for public transportation will only deepen this social atomization.\n",
      "          The advocates of autonomous vehicles claim that eliminating public transportation cuts infrastructure costs, and they might even say, it would make for greener environs. But it is not clear whether the rise in the number of autonomous vehicles will not require comparable infrastructure, as the majority must drive such vehicles if they are to be a feasible option in the first place.\n",
      "         And speaking of majorities, we are brought face to face with another problem: cost. It will surely be a while before self-driven cars are within the means of the majority. And assuming that they could become a viable proposition before the majority of the population owns them, they would in the interim be status symbols, affordable only by the wealthy.  Our already deeply divided society can do without such obvious markers of status differentials.\n",
      "\tAnd then, there is the question of safety. We all know that computer algorithms are not infallible, that programs can be infected with viruses, that hardware can malfunction, that computers are at the mercy of hackers. A human driver has a repertoire of skills to call upon in the event of unforeseen situations: an accident, bad weather, a terrorist attack. As far as I am aware, computer algorithms that function in very dynamic situations without human intervention are not that plentiful. What then would a rider do, especially if they are not tech savvy, in a complex and fluid situation? \n",
      "\tYou may argue that we are daily rendered helpless by such things as drunk or inattentive motorists, with dire consequences that are clear from the statistics about accidents. I cannot disagree. And yet, I find I must stand my ground. \n",
      "\tI ask you to imagine a situation where your self-driving car cannot adapt in time, something as simple as a failure of traffic signals or a sudden thunderstorm, never mind a hacked program or a spectacular terrorist attack. Nor can the cars of anyone else. And you're all headed for disaster with no recourse. Rendered utterly passive where once you might have attempted some solution, no matter its efficacy. \n",
      "\tIt is this removal of human agency, individual and collective,  that I worry about. This helplessness that is not natural human vulnerability but rather thralldom to machines. Unlike human vulnerability, which can breed virtues like compassion and pity, this thralldom is not generative, it is lifeless in the way of an inorganic thing. \n",
