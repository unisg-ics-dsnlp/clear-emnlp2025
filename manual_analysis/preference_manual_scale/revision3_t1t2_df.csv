Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_47.txt,"
Many articles outline the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars, sparking a debate about their integration into society. While proponents highlight reduced accident rates, time efficiency, convenience for the disabled, and smoother traffic, opponents raise concerns about individual privacy violations, unemployment, and performance in severe weather. I argue against the adoption of self-driving cars, citing potential threats to safety, privacy, and employment.

**Safety Concerns:**
Although human error is a leading cause of accidents, mechanical malfunctions still pose a significant risk. Self-driving mechanisms cannot mitigate defects present in a car's construction. In such cases, it's dubious that a computer system can make sound driving decisions. Moreover, human input is still required to facilitate self-driving functions, introducing the possibility of poor decisions or mistakes that could lead to injuries or fatalities. This innovation may bring unforeseen risks, jeopardizing societal harmony.

**Privacy Violations:**
To optimize driving efficiency, built-in computers collect extensive data from nearby vehicles, raising concerns about privacy exploitation. If misused, this feature could aid criminals in evading law enforcement, compromising police officer privacy. The potential for police cars to override all vehicle computer systems also raises fairness and citizen rights questions. Until these concerns are adequately addressed, self-driving cars have a long way to go before being societal beneficiaries.

**Employment and Structural Impacts:**
The displacement of professional drivers could lead to significant unemployment, with far-reaching consequences for the car insurance and traffic guiding sectors. Managing these disruptive changes in the short term poses a considerable challenge for societal stability. While new skills and sectors may emerge, this transformation will require time, effort, sacrifice, and investment. Public institutions must be thoroughly prepared for this transition, which is inherently time-consuming and uncertain.

**Conclusion:**
Self-driving cars may drive industrial, societal, and lifestyle changes, but we must acknowledge the potential costs of such innovation. Given current technical and societal developments, the benefits of self-driving cars may be overstated. Therefore, we should exercise caution when considering the adoption of self-driving cars into our society. ","Many articles provide readers with several straightforward explanations in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. The beneficial side includes lower accident rates due to limited human errors by applying computer systems in cars, time efficiency from the drivers' perspective, convenience for disabled population, and generally smoother traffic. However, the opposing side points out several serious issues to consider, such as the violation of individual privacy, the problem of unemployment, and the inefficiency of self-driving under severe weather. I hold the disagreement toward the pro-side and believe that self-driving cars is more likely to pose unavoidable threats than to bring convenience and well-being to our society. I construct my arguments from the stances of safety, privacy protection, and employment. 
	To start with, it may be the fact that in terms of driving, human errors, other than mechanical malfunctions, cause more frequent and severer accidents. But accidents triggered by mechanical malfunctions still exist and self-driving mechanism has nothing to shift this fact. In particular, considering cars that contain mechanical defects by construction, in such a case, can a built-in computer system make a good driving decision? I highly doubt it. Without more information, we cannot simply assume that computer systems can take fully control of the vehicle, rule all risks out, and ensure 100% safety. Furthermore, drivers or passengers may still play an important role during the driving process; because people need to send commands to the computer system in the car to facilitate the self-driving function. What if people come up with bad decisions or just make mistakes? What if an individual pushes the system to perform personal choices and that causes injuries or death toward people outside of a car? Risks may still be possible under such circumstances. An innovation as a self-driving car can bring challenging risks and potential dangers along the process which will definitely deteriorate the smooth function of our society. 
	Second, it is safe to assume that built-in computers acquire as much information as possible to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the driving actions. That is to say, one car automatically exploits information from all other cars nearby. A potential issue, privacy violation, should be thoroughly considered before we vote a yes to self-driving practice for our society. For example, if criminals make full use of this information-exploitation function, they are able to avoid detection or police chase by flawlessly escaping with the help of an advanced computer tracking system built in the self-driving car. In such a scenario, the privacy of police officers has been violated. Taking a step forward, what if police cars are allowed to override all vehicles' computer systems? Will that be fair to citizens? Do you still vote for self-driving cars in such a societal system? Before these concerns can be satisfactorily solved, self-driving cars, which possibly offers an innovative service to the society and its people, still have a long way to go. 
	Third, it could be a serious concern if the common profession, professional drivers, lose jobs if computer system is the only approved driver for all automobiles. Big structural changes will also take place in the relevant sectors including car insurance industry and traffic guiding system. How should we deal with these disruptive changes in a short run when unemployment impairs the stability of the society? It is true that new skills can be trained and new supporting sectors will emerge, but that takes time, efforts, sacrifices and costs. Public institutions and governments have to get fully prepared for the transition, which, however, can be time-consuming and has the possibility of an unsatisfied outcomes. Self-driving is indeed a risky business. 
	In summary, self-driving cars as a type of innovation will potentially promote the industrial, societal, and lifestyle changes. However, we cannot assume that any change can benefit the development of the society with no cost. Based on current technical and societal development, self-driving cars may not be as beneficial as supporters easily imagine. And we should be cautious of voting for such changes in our society."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_59.txt,"

Self-driving cars are expected to emerge within the next several years, sparking intense debate about their potential impact. While some envision a safer, more efficient future, others vehemently oppose their development. Proponents argue that self-driving cars will minimize accidents (attributed to human error in 81% of cases), enhance transportation for the disabled, and optimize emergency services. Conversely, opponents highlight the challenges of implementation and the subsequent troubles. 

Upon thorough analysis of the benefits and drawbacks, I firmly believe that self-driving cars pose more societal detriments than benefits. Firstly, their projected commercial price of $100,000, largely due to sophisticated machinery like sensors and cameras, will render them inaccessible to most, given the global average household income of approximately $2,500. This exclusivity undermines the potential benefits, as only the affluent will be able to afford them.

Furthermore, the introduction of self-driving cars will precipitate significant societal disruption. The inevitable extension of this technology to trucks, buses, planes, and trains will obviate the need for human operators, potentially displacing millions in the transportation sector. This could lead to prolonged unemployment, increased crime rates as individuals seek alternative means of sustenance, and a decline in consumer spending. The resultant loss of revenue will adversely affect businesses, both small and large, ultimately harming the economy.

Lastly, the vulnerability of self-driving cars to hacking, as noted by The Guardian, compromises their primary safety advantage. The ease with which hackers could manipulate these vehicles to cause accidents undermines the fundamental rationale for their development.

In conclusion, self-driving cars present more problems than solutions for society, primarily due to their exorbitant cost, the substantial job losses and resultant economic strain, and their susceptibility to hacking, which negates their safety benefits. ","Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a safer and more efficient future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as emergency services can deal with other life-threatening problems instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation and the many troubles that will arise after implementation. 
	After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that self-driving cars are more of a detriment to society than benefit. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be once they reach commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery, like sensors and cameras, will be needed to make a self-driving car. This will contribute greatly to the projected average price of $100,000. With such a large asking price, the majority of the world population will not be able to afford these cars with the world average household income around $2,500. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to buy them. 
	Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, like trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on these vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job and if they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime to feed themselves and their families. Additionally, with such a large amount of people out of jobs, they do not have any spending money. Many businesses, small large, will lose these customers. The loss of these customers will induce a loss of profit which will hurt such businesses. This will then hurt the economy. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, possibly increasing crime and definitely hurting the economy.
	The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised as mentioned by the Guardian. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, the whole idea of having self-driving cars can be disregarded entirely. 
	To conclude, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions to society. This is because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_53.txt,"As the years go by, our society, especially American society, continues to reach farther and farther into the future. One of the up-and-coming debates of recent years is self-driving cars. While they are still in their infancy, self-driving cars have both potential advantages and disadvantages for future use. Some of the advantages include a reduction in motor vehicle accidents for the general population. There are many reasons as to why this may occur. First, there are no opportunities for a computer to become distracted while driving.  Because computers use several different complicated algorithms to determine different factors for safe driving, such as appropriate stopping distance and the distance from other vehicles, this would dramatically decrease the chances of a car accident. Besides just safety, self-driving cars would be beneficial to society in other ways as well. Self-driving cars would also be beneficial for disabled individuals who mainly have to rely on public transportation or assistance to get around. 
        While the self-driving car has its advantages, it also has disadvantages as well. One of the main concerns is cost. 
The cost of implementing self-driving cars is too expensive for the average citizen to be able to reasonably afford.  Along with the cost, there is the implication that if self-driving cars are adopted and widely used, this could have a negative impact on public transportation that was already in existence. For example, taxi drivers, buses, etc. While the costs are a main concern, with new technology, comes new unknowns.  These unknowns could range from malfunctions or repairs or possibly even lawsuits with private data of the individual and the list goes on and on.  Self-driving cars have a lot of unknowns simply because they haven't been put out for widespread use in our society yet.  As time passes, once they are continually used, this will not be the case.  While there are several advantages to self-driving cars, if they are implemented correctly, at this moment in time self-driving cars seem to be more detrimental than beneficial to society at such a primal stage of development. 
	Self-driving cars, if implemented correctly, would bring society further into the future. However, at this stage self-driving cars are not beneficial to society. Ideally, cars that are controlled by computers could reduce accidents. However, with this new technology there are several unknowns.  For example, one of the cons for self-driving cars is adaptation. It's unclear as to how self-driving cars would maneuver through roadblocks or unique local driving laws. Computers could have difficulty identifying the different local and state rules with regard to the road. Another issue for self-driving cars is reliability. If I'm going to put my life in the hands of a self-driving car, personally I would need to know that it is guaranteed not to malfunction. As of now, there's no guarantee. The main point for the counter argument for self-driving cars being beneficial to society is that it will reduce accidents. However, I don't see that as a strong point. There's absolutely no guarantee that accidents will be reduced because there is no evidence that the computer in the self-driving car would be able to adapt to certain conditions that might cause an accident. Further, isn't it a possibility for computers to still make mistakes? With this said, while self-driving cars may be beneficial to society at some point down the road, there still needs to be a lot more testing done to ensure and fully guarantee the safety of passengers. As of now, with so many unknown problems, self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.","As society continues to advance, debates surrounding emerging technologies like self-driving cars have gained prominence, particularly in American society. While still in their developmental stage, self-driving cars present both potential benefits and drawbacks. 

**Advantages:**
- **Enhanced Road Safety:** Self-driving cars can significantly reduce motor vehicle accidents due to the absence of human distractions. Sophisticated algorithms enable precise control over safe driving factors, such as stopping distances and vehicle spacing, thereby minimizing accident risks.
- **Increased Mobility for the Disabled:** Self-driving cars offer freedom and independence to disabled individuals, who currently rely heavily on public transportation or assistance for mobility.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Prohibitive Costs:** The high implementation cost of self-driving cars makes them unaffordable for the average citizen, posing a significant barrier to widespread adoption.
- **Impact on Existing Public Transportation:** Wide adoption of self-driving cars could negatively affect the livelihoods of taxi drivers, bus operators, and other public transportation workers.
- **Technological Unknowns:** The novelty of self-driving cars introduces uncertainties, including potential malfunctions, repair complexities, and legal issues concerning private data, which will only be fully understood with broader deployment.

**Conclusion:**
While self-driving cars, if implemented correctly, could propel society forward, their current stage of development suggests more detriment than benefit. The potential to reduce accidents is overshadowed by concerns over adaptation to variable road conditions and local laws, reliability, and the inevitability of computer errors. Extensive testing is necessary to guarantee passenger safety. Until then, the numerous unknowns make self-driving cars a less beneficial option for society at this time. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_58.txt,"
The rapid advancement of technology often sparks controversy in society, and the integration of self-driving cars is no exception. While this innovation showcases human ingenuity, several crucial questions must be addressed before its widespread adoption.

The concept of autonomous vehicles has transitioned from science fiction to reality in a remarkably short period. Now, as we witness their functionality, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons. One significant advantage is enhanced safety. An ideally designed self-driving car boasts a higher safety rating than human drivers, as computers focus solely on the road, unencumbered by distractions, fatigue, or intoxication. 

Furthermore, self-driving cars can optimize traffic patterns by coordinating with multiple vehicles, maintaining safe distances, and communicating road conditions through features like ""platooning."" This could revolutionize the driving experience, potentially eliminating rush hour, reducing insurance and healthcare costs due to decreased accidents, and offering numerous benefits across the driving spectrum.

However, several pressing concerns must be resolved before self-driving cars become street-legal. The legal and moral implications of accidents involving autonomous vehicles are complex, necessitating discussions on ""trolley problems,"" blame assignment, and public reconciliation with the inevitability of accidents. Additionally, the widespread adoption of this technology might erode human driving skills, leading to new societal challenges. The risk of hacking also poses a significant threat, as evidenced by instances of high-end cars being remotely controlled. Moreover, unresolved technological issues, such as weather functionality and GPS accuracy, could compromise the vehicles' safety and efficiency.

Given the multifaceted nature of this issue, it's prudent that fully functional autonomous vehicles are still in the developmental stage. While acknowledging the potential benefits, this writer also recognizes the need for caution. The allure of self-driving cars must be balanced against the potential loss of personal driving experiences and the reliability of classic cars. Perhaps, it's wise to reassess the technology's readiness in a decade, allowing for more comprehensive solutions to the challenges it presents. ","The forward march of technology has always been a source of controversy in society. Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slate with pencil and paper in schoolhouses created public dialogue, so it is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is undoubtedly exciting, exemplifying our problem solving capabilities and perseverance. However, before it can be applied in our day to day lives, many important questions need to be answered first. 
	Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will  have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because the computer only needs to focus on the road. They don't worried about kids, their days, or their hectic schedule like humans do, nor can they get drunk or daydream. Computers are programmed to be idea, defensive drivers so that the likelihood of accidents are decreased. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more! A function called ""platooning"" allows self-driving cars to work together to reduce traffic and avoid crashes. This would result in a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might become a thing of the past, insurance and healthcare costs would decrease because of the reduced number of accidents. There are a plethora of benefits to autonomous vehicles across all aspects of the driving experience. 
	However, there are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. ""Trolley problems"", blame assignment, legal debates, and public discussions must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Humans might lose the ability to be effective drivers because they never needed to learn how. Also, hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology which have been hacked to give a remote user full control of a vehicle. If a hacker could gain control of a vehicle's operating system, lives could be threatened. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Thunderstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them. A driver that goes blind every time it rains is not a good driver.
	There are so many angles to this problem that its probably a good thing we are still far off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but also the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they can hit the roads. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of something else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave that pushes our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for fleets of autonomous vehicles with no identity, reliability, or accountability. I say wait a decade and see where the technology is then."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_9.txt,"Self-driving vehicles will decrease fatalities, shave time off commutes, decrease the amount of money being spent on mass transit, add to economies, and provide more options of transportation for the disabled. Roughly 81% of car crashes are due to human error, and 33,000 traffic related deaths are more than likely preventable yearly. At least one of these options directly relates to each, and every person in a given community. Many issues that plague individuals revolve around transportation. From having to wake up earlier in the day because of an increased workload to compensate for traffic, to getting a call that a loved one was in an accident. The increased amount of self-driving vehicles being adopted by consumers will have a positive correlation with the daily lives of those that do not own them. The need for people to develop systems, and build the vehicles will definitively have a positive correlation on economies.
	Currently, the U.S. Department of Transportation has assessed the value of a life at $9.2 million. By way of safer roads through self-driving vehicles being more prevalent, because of factors such as the reduction of human error through computers doing the driving, the amount of money being spent by insurance companies will drive down insurance premiums so they can remain competitive. Chris Urmson, who is the director of Google's self-driving car division, makes the claim that self driving vehicles are safer because of their inherent cautionary measures. As these vehicles become more common on the roads the cost to purchase them will go down. Production levels, and the increase of safety having an adverse relationship with vehicles that require human interaction will further drive down cost.
      As it currently sits seven different agencies have taken steps to begin the development of self driving vehicles. Companies will find ways to lower costs through more efficient methods of production, and distribution as industry competitiveness increases. The savings of money is then passed down to local, and state governments because of less money being spent on methods of mass transit. The savings of money is then passed down to local, and state governments because of less money being spent on methods of mass transit. Crumbling, or nonexistent, local infrastructures will gain a sense of relief from the self driving car industry from the lower amount of people utilizing the systems. City buses, and train maintenance costs will plummet, and those savings are then passed down to the tax paying citizens of the said cities, and states. 
	A caveat of self-driving vehicles is the effect that it will have on some employers. The plentiful amount of vehicles which will transport its occupants will decrease the need for public transportation, and taxi services. This will happen through the constant adoption, evolution, and efficiency of self driving vehicles. These types of vehicles communicate with one another through a method called platooning. In the midst of their communication they will be able to identify traffic patterns, and alternate routes to their destination. This adaptation is something that public transit employees are not able to do because of specified routes that they must take. Though there may be a reduction in those fields of employment other opportunities will undoubtedly be created. An increased need for engineers, auto mechanics, road repairmen/women, and salespeople will have a profound impact on economies. 
     Another probable area of concern that various entities would have is the possibility of a car malfunctioning by not identifying incoming danger. Yesterday there was a report of a self driving vehicle that did not identify a stopped police car. In turn the car struck the police cruiser, causing significant damage to both vehicles involved. This fault could have been from inferior identification systems, or a failed algorithm. Had the driver been paying attention, and not solely relying on the self driving system in his/her vehicle it is quite possible that they could have compensated for the missed vehicle identification by the autonomous system in their vehicle. 
	The supporters, and people that oppose of self-driving vehicles both have valid concerns for their positions. But, if there can be a value put on a human life then isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t there a way that we can save on those costs by mitigating the instances of death? Self-driving vehicles is the way to make that come to fruition. The constant development of safety measures in the autonomous systems will get better as consumers adopt more of the vehicles. Accounts of drunk, tired, and distracted driving will continuously plummet. All of these issues of distraction are corrected from the constantly evolving algorithms that account for problems quicker than humans can react to. Therefore, making the roads safer for us all.","
Self-driving vehicles promise a transformative impact on society, offering numerous benefits that can improve the daily lives of individuals and communities. These advantages include a significant decrease in fatalities, reduced commute times, lower expenditures on mass transit, economic growth, and enhanced transportation options for the disabled.

**Enhanced Safety and Economic Benefits**

* Approximately 81% of car crashes are attributed to human error, resulting in around 33,000 potentially preventable traffic-related deaths annually. Self-driving vehicles, by mitigating human error through computer-driven precision, can drastically reduce these statistics.
* The U.S. Department of Transportation values a life at $9.2 million. Widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles, with their inherent cautionary measures (as noted by Chris Urmson, Director of Google's self-driving car division), will lead to safer roads, prompting insurance companies to lower premiums to remain competitive.

**Economic Growth and Infrastructure Relief**

* As self-driving vehicles become more common, production costs will decrease due to increased efficiency and competitiveness, making them more accessible to consumers.
* Seven agencies have initiated self-driving vehicle development, driving innovation and cost reduction through more efficient production and distribution methods. These savings will trickle down to local and state governments, reducing mass transit expenditures.
* The decreased reliance on public transportation will alleviate the financial burden on crumbling or nonexistent local infrastructures, leading to plummeting city bus and train maintenance costs, with the savings ultimately benefiting tax-paying citizens.

**Addressing Employment Concerns and Technological Challenges**

* While the adoption of self-driving vehicles may reduce the need for public transportation and taxi services, it will also create new employment opportunities in fields such as engineering, auto mechanics, road repair, and sales, positively impacting economies.
* The concern of vehicle malfunctions, such as the recent incident involving a self-driving vehicle failing to identify a stopped police car, highlights the importance of continuous improvement in identification systems and algorithms. However, with attentive drivers and evolving safety measures, such risks can be significantly mitigated.

**Conclusion**

Both supporters and opponents of self-driving vehicles have valid concerns. However, if a monetary value can be placed on a human life, shouldn't we strive to reduce the financial and emotional costs associated with preventable deaths? The ongoing development and adoption of self-driving vehicles, with their capacity to correct issues of distraction (drunk, tired, and distracted driving) more effectively than humans, present a compelling solution. As these vehicles evolve, they will undoubtedly make our roads safer for everyone. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_1.txt,"
The topic of self-driving cars is highly debated and pertinent to today’s society, particularly in light of the Arizona incident involving a self-driving Uber. Despite this, the benefits of adopting self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks due to the significant reduction in accidents and costs. 

**Key Advantages:**
- **Enhanced Safety**: Self-driving cars minimize accidents caused by distracted drivers, with statistics showing human error is responsible for 81% of crashes, resulting in approximately 1.3 million fatalities annually.
- **Improved Traffic Flow**: Autonomous vehicles optimize traffic, reducing congestion and commute times.
- **Economic Benefits**: Self-driving cars save time and monetary resources, potentially increasing productivity.
- **Increased Accessibility**: They offer transportation to all citizens, including the elderly and disabled.

**Addressing Concerns:**
- **Technological Limitations**: While the system is not flawless and faces a learning curve, it has the capacity to evolve, unlike human driving skills which have plateaued.
- **Economic Impact on Other Sectors**: Although self-driving cars may initially affect profit in other transportation industries, the overall economic gain from developing and implementing this technology will be more substantial, creating new job opportunities in the growing tech sector.
- **Loss Prevention**: Each life saved (valued at $9.2 million by the U.S. Department of Transportation) contributes to a more productive workforce, reducing healthcare and insurance costs.

**Integration and Future:**
- **Existing Implementation**: Features like autonomous braking, self-parking, and sensor detectors are already integrated into modern vehicles, demonstrating the technology's readiness for further development.
- **Conclusion**: Despite imperfections, the potential of self-driving cars to save lives and reduce costs makes them a worthy investment for societal progression. As our reliance on technology grows, embracing self-driving cars aligns with the innovative spirit of the 21st century. ","The topic of self-driving cars is both highly debated and relevant to today’s society. In light of recent events with the death of an Arizona woman at the hands of a self-driving Uber, many are conflicted on what stance to take on the matter. Arguments for self-driving cars include they reduce the number of accidents resulting from distracted drivers, improve traffic flow, are cost saving in terms of time and monetary value, and may permit increased access to transportation to all citizens. Arguments against self-driving cars include the system does not eliminate accidents completely, there is a learning curve with the technology, it would reduce profit from other transportation sectors in the economy, and that there are instances in which the technology is not equipped to make human judgement decisions. While both sides provide valid points, the benefits of adopting a system of self-driving cars rise to the forefront due to the lives and money saved. 
	Many people are quick to call attention to the flaws in self-driving cars but the technology is still in its infancy and has the capability to develop and improve with time, whereas we have not seen this progression in human motorists over the years. Certainly we could expect the number of accidents caused by self-driving cars to rise as it is more widely adopted, but this number palls in comparison to the number of accidents caused by drivers themselves. Tragedies such as those in Arizona should not happen, but unfortunately with nearly 1.3 million people dying in motor vehicle accidents a year and 81 percent of accidents being a result of human error, it appears the main culprit is us. As humans we currently rely on computers and technology for many of our daily tasks, and self-driving cars are an extension of the innovative and tech driven culture our society has already embraced. 
	Those against also argue that investing in self-driving cars may take away money from other industries. Again while self-driving cars may impact the profit of alternate transportation systems, overall the profits from developing and implementing this technology will outweigh the losses. There is a reason many people invest in tech companies, such as Google, as they have become more profitable in the 21st century. Especially with the start-up investment in new technology, as the industry grows this will demand more and more jobs to be created that can replace those lost. Also, the savings in terms of reduced accidents are astronomical. The U.S. Department of Transportation assigned a value of 9.2 million for each human life, with savings coming from venues such as healthcare and insurance. Each life saved from switching to self-driving cars is another member of society with the potential to become a productive member of our workforce. There is also the argument that self-driving cars may save you time as they free up your transit time to attend to other daily tasks when you do not have to focus on the driving. With more efficient driving the self-driving cars have the potential to decrease driving time and traffic as well. 
	Though people are still resistant to the idea of self-driving cars it is already in ways being implemented into our driving with features such as autonomous braking, self-parking and sensor detectors. The technology for this field is currently available and calls on our investment to develop and improve. While no system is perfect, one that saves us lives and on costs should be highly considered."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_79.txt,"Today's world is punctuated by new innovations and technologies being released every day. An intriguing one that generates equal interest and consternation across the United States is the technology of self-driving cars. Supporters of self-driving cars note that it would revolutionize traffic patterns therefore improving fuel efficiency, that it would dramatically reduce car-related morbidity and mortality, and that it would allow disabled and elderly individuals independence and the ability to travel freely unlike they could before. However on the opposite side of things, opponents note that self-driving cars pose new risks and concerns as well. Concerns include their inability to operate in adverse weather conditions, their inability to handle unique road conditions and human traffic signals when mechanical traffic signals aren't present, and the general wariness that many consumers have for self-driving cars and if the technology would ever even be widely accepted enough for use. 
	Personally, I find the benefits to self-driving cars significantly outweigh the negative factors. Self-driving cars provide a safe, efficient platform that can reduce motor vehicle accident associated fatalities and injuries significantly, reduce the time of commutes and the cost associated with extended periods of driving, and allows people who aren't able to drive such as the disabled and elderly a newfound freedom that so many who have access to cars take for granted. The large predicted reduction in car accident related injuries and deaths is easily the best supporting reason for self driving cars. It has been reported that up to 81% of motor vehicle accidents are due to human error. These human-caused accidents could be completely mitigated by computers who don't have the capability to be distracted, tired, drunk, or any other factor that reduces a human's ability to drive safely. By taking the human factor out of driving, countless lives and debilitating injuries can be prevented with self-driving cars. Another benefit of self-driving cars is their potential to revolutionize traffic patterns via their ability to ""platoon"" where they drive in coordinated packs together. The source article notes how platooning removes the human inefficiency of driving that causes traffic jams and congestion and would therefore reduce commute times and subsequently optimize fuel efficiency to save consumers more money on gasoline. These benefits of platooning are attractive selling points to consumers for why self-driving cars should be more widely accepted. Lastly comes the ability of self-cars to substantially improve the lives of individuals who can't drive such as the elderly and disabled. In a Department of Transportation study, Burkhardt and fellow co-authors found that in elderly woman who stopped driving that they reported increased depressive symptoms, loss of independence, increased financial costs, and increased feelings of isolation. Self-driving cars would be a perfect solution to the problem Burkhardt found, self-driving cars could return independence to those individuals and reduce the negative factors associated with not being able to drive, therefore improving their quality of life. 
	Of course however, there are negative factors to self-driving cars that are valid and warrant consideration as well. Opponents to self-driving cars note that the technology just isn't ready yet, self-driving cars still can't handle poor weather conditions such as heavy rain, they cannot accommodate for human traffic signals when regular traffic signals fail, and that there is still a general opposition to the idea of drivers relinquishing control of their cars to a computer which could potentially put them in dangerous situations. However, many of these concerns can be remedied with time and further development. As the technology matures and barriers are hurdled, these risks will be mitigated and self-driving cars can progressively become widely accepted.","

Today, innovative technologies are transforming industries worldwide, with self-driving cars being a particularly intriguing example in the United States, sparking both enthusiasm and apprehension. Proponents argue that self-driving cars will revolutionize traffic patterns, enhancing fuel efficiency, drastically reducing car-related accidents and fatalities, and granting independence to the disabled and elderly. Conversely, opponents highlight concerns including operational challenges in adverse weather, unique road conditions without mechanical signals, and consumer wariness about adopting autonomous vehicles.

Personally, I firmly believe the benefits of self-driving cars far outweigh the drawbacks. They offer a safe, efficient platform capable of significantly reducing motor vehicle accident fatalities and injuries, cutting commute times and associated costs, and providing unprecedented freedom to those unable to drive, such as the disabled and elderly. The predicted substantial reduction in car accident-related injuries and deaths is the most compelling argument. Given that up to 81% of motor vehicle accidents are attributed to human error, replacing human drivers with computers—immune to distraction, fatigue, intoxication, and other impairments—could prevent countless lives lost and debilitating injuries.

Moreover, self-driving cars have the potential to transform traffic patterns through ""platooning,"" where they drive in coordinated groups. This practice, as noted in the source article, eliminates the human inefficiencies causing traffic jams and congestion, thereby reducing commute times, optimizing fuel efficiency, and saving consumers money on gasoline. These platooning benefits are significant selling points for wider acceptance of self-driving cars.

Notably, self-driving cars can profoundly improve the lives of the non-driving population, including the elderly and disabled. A Department of Transportation study by Burkhardt et al. found that elderly women who stopped driving reported increased depressive symptoms, loss of independence, higher financial costs, and feelings of isolation. Self-driving cars offer a solution, potentially restoring independence, reducing negative outcomes associated with not driving, and enhancing their quality of life.

While valid, the concerns about self-driving cars—unreadiness of the technology, inability to handle poor weather, accommodate human traffic signals, and the fear of relinquishing control to a computer—can be addressed with time and development. As the technology matures and overcomes these barriers, the associated risks will diminish, paving the way for broader acceptance of self-driving cars. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_46.txt,"It is hard to be a pioneer in any kind of area. When it comes to the self-driving cars, we do not have that notion of having a car without the driver. Nowadays, it is even hard to imagine seeing cars without drivers. Thus, for those who are trying to develop self-driving cars, it is challenging to present all benefits of that type of the car.  
	The main advantage of developing this new technological development is to reduce car accidents. If you pull out some statistical data about car accidents, you can observe that the main cause of the road accident is the mistake made by a human-driver. This must have been the motivation behind creating self-driving cars. As developers are performing some test-drives on self-driving cars, there is the evidence that those cars might significantly decrease the rate of car accidents. It would help us save millions of lives and dollars. However, some people may argue that self-driving cars are not perfect enough, especially in case of driving in severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog and so on.  
	Another advantage of self-driving cars is saving some money and here are two reasons why. First, getting this kind of a car means that the owner will pay less for the car insurance, or not even have one. Second, it would help drivers to save some expenses because self-driving cars are run by electricity. Moreover, the latter helps us retain a sustainable environment. However, there are still some people that might argue with the aforementioned advantage. Instead of saving money, the owners of those fancy cars might end by paying more because self-driving cars will cost approximately $100 000 on average. However, in the far future, that cost might decrease as the competition rate among car manufacturing companies rises. 
	The last but not the least benefit of getting a self-driving car is saving some time. If we have self-driving cars on our streets, we will no longer need to take driving courses and going through the process of plenty of examinations to get the driver's license. There will be still time consumption in terms of learning to control self-driving cars. However, in comparison to the time spent on obtaining a driver's license, the latter is the best option that we want to consider.  
	Overall, it is clear that the advantages of developing self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages. Self-driving cars not just help preventing people to get in car accidents, but also help drivers to save money and time on obtaining driver's license. Even though there are some  minor drawbacks of this new technological development, I believe that in the near future we will witness a vast number of self-driving cars in the streets.","
It's challenging to pioneer innovative technologies, especially when they revolutionize familiar concepts, such as driverless vehicles. Imagining roads without drivers is still difficult, making it hard for developers to fully articulate the benefits of self-driving cars.

**Primary Advantage: Enhanced Road Safety**
Statistical data on car accidents consistently points to human error as the leading cause. This glaring issue likely motivated the creation of self-driving cars. Test drives have shown promising results, indicating a potential significant decrease in accident rates, which could save millions of lives and dollars. However, critics argue about the technology's reliability in severe weather conditions like heavy rain or fog.

**Financial Savings: A Two-Fold Benefit**
1. **Reduced Insurance Costs**: Owners of self-driving cars may enjoy lower insurance premiums or possibly none at all.
2. **Energy Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability**: Powered by electricity, these cars not only save owners money on fuel but also contribute to a more sustainable environment. 
Some might counter that the high initial cost (approximately $100,000 on average) outweighs these savings. However, as competition among manufacturers increases, prices are likely to decrease in the future.

**Time Efficiency: A Bonus Advantage**
With self-driving cars, the traditional process of driving courses and licensing exams becomes obsolete. While there may still be a learning curve for operating these vehicles, it's significantly less time-consuming than obtaining a driver's license.

**Conclusion**
The benefits of self-driving cars—enhanced safety, financial savings, and time efficiency—clearly outweigh the drawbacks. While minor issues exist, it's plausible that the near future will see a proliferation of self-driving cars on our streets, preventing accidents, saving resources, and streamlining mobility. "

Behind our ever-evolving society is the transformative power of technology, enhancing efficiency in daily life and saving precious time. However, when applied to complex systems like self-driving cars, numerous challenges arise. Despite touted benefits such as reduced accidents and driving time, significant drawbacks persist, including substantial expenses, potential technology failures, and concerns over job elimination in transportation sectors. Until these issues are adequately addressed, self-driving cars remain overly ambitious and potentially hazardous. Their current technological flaws outweigh their societal benefits.

Proponents highlight the efficiency of self-driving cars in reducing congestion and driving time, thereby saving money in the long run. Advanced algorithms enable precise navigation, but achieving this sophistication requires considerable time and financial investment in research and development. This investment is crucial for ensuring consumer safety and satisfaction, mitigating potential lawsuits. However, even with advanced complexity, these systems struggle to replicate human interaction, such as understanding police directions or hand signals during traffic light failures. High intelligence technology still falters in comprehending variable human communication cues.

The possibility of accidents with self-driving cars also remains a concern. While they aim to reduce crashes caused by human instability or poor judgment (e.g., driving under the influence or diminished senses with age), the risk of accidents is not eradicated. Issues arise when a car's self-driving technology fails, leaving an unstable driver unable to intervene, or when weather conditions (like heavy rain or snow damaging the roof sensor) compromise safety. This raises a critical question: what happens when the self-driving technology fails? The role of the human driver in a self-driving car is notably ambiguous, as these autonomous vehicles inherently remove control from the driver.

In the allure of emerging technologies, from smartphones to headphones, it's easy to get captivated. With self-driving cars, it's crucial not to be swayed by their promise without scrutinizing their implementation. While their potential warrants exploration, the current state of self-driving cars is underdeveloped, offering no tangible benefits to society due to the myriad unresolved issues requiring significant time and effort to rectify. ","Behind our ever-evolving society is the driving force of technology, enabling us to do things in our daily lives more quickly and efficiently, saving us time that we consider precious and not to be wasted. When we apply technology to our everyday lives, there are a number of issues that can possibly arise. This can be seen very clearly in the topic of self-driving cars. While there are several eye-catching benefits, such as the possibility of decreased accidents and shortened driving time, there are also drawbacks. These drawbacks include glaringly large expenses, the possibility of technology failure, and concerns regarding the elimination of transportation jobs, like taxi drivers. Unless, these problems and questions regarding self-driving cars are resolved, they stand as dangerous and overly-ambitious ideas that should not be allowed on the road. Self-driving cars are not beneficial to society due to the amounts of flaws within the technology of these futuristic machines. 
	Supporters of these cars flaunt how efficient they can be because they can cut down space and driving time, ultimately saving money in the long-run. Road congestion can be cut down because of the detailed algorithms of these cars that allow them to do things such as determining distances from objects and other vehicles. Nevertheless, to reach this stated level of sophistication, much time and money will have to occur. Research and development alone is an extremely costly and risky long-term investment, but it would be necessary in order to secure the consumer's satisfaction and safety to avoid possible lawsuits. And while the computers within a self-driving car are ideally so complex that they can function completely independently, this does not allow them to be able to identify things a human could, like if a police officer was directing traffic. Another case in which sensors cannot pick up human interaction is when drivers use hand signals when traffic lights are broken. Even technology of high intelligence would still be unable to comprehend the variability of basic human communication. 
	There is also the possibility of accidents occurring with these cars. One rebutting benefit of self-driving cars is that they will decrease the number of car accidents, due to a human driver's unstable state of mind or poor choices. Such situations are seen with drivers who are under the influence, or those who are older and have duller senses and reaction times. However, the likelihood of a car accident is not completely zero, despite how hi-tech and sharp these cars are. For one, drivers who are in an unstable state of mind may not be able to take control of their car in the case the self-driving technology of the car fails or malfunctions. In addition, under certain weather conditions, the car's level of safety is compromised. For example, the sensor atop the car's roof can be damaged by heavy rain or snow. Even little damage could trigger an error in the system and endanger passengers. This leads to a bigger question: what will happen once the self-driving technology of the car fails? The role that the human driver has when placed within a self-driving car is very ambiguous. The self-driving car is indeed a piece of autonomous technology that strips control from its human drivers. 
	People are often so easily infatuated with the bright shiny pieces of technology that emerge onto the mainstream, whether it be the newest smartphone or pair of headphones. With self-driving cars, it is important to not be swept up in the wild fantasies of these machines. While the potential of self-driving cars is certainly something to explore and inspect, the implementation of these cars is immature and yields no benefits to society, as there are too many issues that will require much time and effort to thoroughly resolve."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_51.txt,"
There are both advantages and disadvantages to adopting self-driving cars. Proponents argue that human error, often caused by distraction or poor judgement, is a primary contributor to accidents, and that autonomous driving can positively impact the future by eliminating traffic congestion and enhancing mobility for the disabled. 

However, several concerns surround self-driving cars. The high cost of components, likely to be borne by consumers, raises questions about affordability. Moreover, durability is a concern, both in terms of hardware resilience (e.g., snow-covered sensors) and cybersecurity (e.g., algorithm exploitation by malicious hackers). The vast data requirements for vehicle localization also spark significant privacy concerns.

As technology increasingly replaces human roles across society, from manufacturing to communication, a pivotal question arises: not how far can we replace humans, but how far should we? This query is pertinent as companies like Google and Tesla advance autonomous driving capabilities. While demonstrations showcase the industry's feasibility, it's crucial to assess whether self-driving cars truly benefit society.

Personally, I remain unconvinced that self-driving cars are a definitive societal benefit. By adopting an unproven, expensive platform, we place our lives in the hands of network-tied machines. Society becomes vulnerable to dependency on technology, disregarding that machines, like their human creators, are error-prone. Bugs, crashes, and algorithm manipulation pose risks, as evidenced by fatal self-driving Tesla accidents, highlighting that computer errors can be as deadly as human ones.

The prevailing ""technology can do no wrong"" mindset exacerbates consequences when failures occur, endangering safety and privacy on a massive scale. Recent events, such as the 2016 election season, have demonstrated the potential for technology to be leveraged for chaos. Trusting tech with high-speed, life-threatening operations is particularly questionable.

Furthermore, the required technology for reliable autonomous vehicles is cost-prohibitive, with $100,000 in sensors and software added to the consumer's bill. These sensors are unlikely to function in extreme conditions like blizzards, and the software relies on error-prone GPS. This underscores that, sometimes, advanced technology cannot replace the reliability of human senses and common sense.

Notably, advancements in automobile safety and road governance have significantly reduced fatalities over the last decade. Redirecting funds towards enhancing safety mechanisms, rather than reinventing the wheel with expensive, unproven self-driving cars, might yield a preferable balance where technological advancements offer road conveniences without surrendering vehicle control. ","There are many advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars. Those who argue for them state that so long as a human is behind the wheel, there is bound to be an accident due to the error in human judgement or distraction. Many other factors, from the potential to eliminate traffic to assisting disabled people with their travels, are listed as ways in which autonomous driving can shape the future positively. 
	Disadvantages of self-driving cars, however, are also myriad. They are composed of expensive components, with costs likely to be paid by the consumer. There is the question of durability concerning both the components and the network; could a self-driving car operate should snow cover its sensors, or if malicious hackers seek to exploit the algorithm? And what of privacy concerns, as cars requires enormous quantities of data to localize themselves? 
	As technology evolves to replace more aspects of society, from automated manufacturing to long-distance communications, there lies a question not of how far one CAN go in replacing humans, but rather how far one SHOULD go in doing so. This question presents itself as tech companies from Google to Tesla demonstrate more ways for cars to pilot themselves. But while the fancy demos show the feasibility of this nascent industry, can the self-driving car truly be a benefit to society? 
	I for one do not believe that self-driving cars are a definite benefit to society. By buying in to such a largely unproven and expensive platform, we place our lives squarely in the hands of a machine tied to a network. Society as a whole will be extremely vulnerable if ""progress"" is an ever-increasing blind faith and dependency on technology. Proponents of autonomous vehicles who are quick to point out ""human error"" as justification forget that machines are just as vulnerable as the humans who made them. Bugs can occur, computers can crash, and anyone with know-how can manipulate any algorithm. As recent fatal accidents involving self-driving Teslas show, computer errors can be just as deadly as human ones.
Combine this with the ever-prevalent mindset that technology can ""do no wrong,"" and the consequences become far more severe when things do go wrong. Such false sense of security endangers the safety and privacy of millions. The ability for nefarious actors to cause chaos via technology was on full display during the 2016 election season, yet proponents of self-driving cars suggest that technology is still not embedded deeply enough in our lives. There may be situations where one can trust tech to do the right thing all the time; operating a high-speed vehicle with life-threatening consequences is not one of them. 
	Furthermore, the technology necessary to implement a worry-free autonomous vehicle is prohibitively expensive. To be specific, $100,000 in sensors and software is heaped onto the consumer; we're talking $100,000 in sensors that most likely won't function in extreme conditions such as blizzards, and software that is based on the infamously error-prone GPS. This goes to show that sometimes the most expensive and advanced technology can't replace the reliability of human eyesight, motor skills and common sense. 
	Not mentioned in the article by Auto Insurance Center is that advances in automobile safety, and the laws that govern the roads we drive on, have drastically decreased fatalities over the last decade. If funds were spent to continue improving safety mechanisms, rather than on reinventing the wheel with expensive and unproven self-driving cars, then we may find a preferable equilibrium in which technological advances provide more conveniences on the road, without having us completely surrender control over our vehicles."
