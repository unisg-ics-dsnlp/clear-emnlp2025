over_the_counter_morning_after_pill (en),micro_b037,"The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies. Even with state-of-the-art contraceptives there can be mistakes and problems and an unwanted pregnancy can place a significant strain on both the parents and the child for the rest of their lives. Some worry about careless use of such measures, but this problem should rather be addressed with comprehensive prior education.","The morning-after pill should be readily available over-the-counter in pharmacies. Despite advancements in contraceptive technology, mistakes and failures can still occur, leading to unintended pregnancies that may impose lifelong emotional, financial, and psychological burdens on both parents and child. Concerns about potential misuse can be effectively mitigated through comprehensive, evidence-based sexual health education, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive well-being."
higher_dog_poo_fines (en),micro_b002,"One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neukölln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt. And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many 'land mines' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles. Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent, lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners. Of course, first they'd actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers, but once they have to dig into their pockets, their laziness will sure vanish!","In densely populated areas like Friedrichshain and Neukölln, the perpetual threat of dog feces has become a frustrating reality. The unpleasant experience of stepping into a 'land mine' and the subsequent tedious cleanup process can be deterrent enough, but it's the irresponsible dog owners who remain the root of the problem. Implementing higher fines for non-compliant owners is a justified measure to combat negligence, laziness, or sheer inconsideration. Although effective enforcement relies on public order officers catching offenders in the act, the financial penalty is likely to serve as a strong motivator, prompting owners to take their responsibilities more seriously and ultimately leading to cleaner, more considerate public spaces."
charge_tuition_fees (en),micro_b028,"The implementation of tuition fees in German universities is unjustifiable, as it would disproportionately hinder or entirely prevent access to higher education for financially disadvantaged individuals. Fortunately, the intended goals of tuition fees, such as promoting academic discipline, can be effectively achieved through alternative measures. Moreover, policymakers should focus on exploring equitable solutions to reimburse students from other federal states for incurred costs, thereby ensuring that funding concerns are addressed without compromising educational accessibility.",The universities in Germany should not under any circumstances charge tuition fees. This would impede or prevent access to those who are financially weaker. The anticipated objectives of tuition fees can be achieved by other means. There are other instruments to motivate tighter discipline while studying. And funding-wise it ought to be considered how costs incurred by students from other (federal) states can be reimbursed.
school_uniforms (en),micro_b038,"School uniforms should be reintroduced in our schools to promote a more egalitarian environment. By doing so, we can achieve a superficial yet significant equalization in our economically driven society, thereby reducing potential discrimination against financially and socially disadvantaged students. Additionally, uniforms would simplify the identification of truants attempting to skip classes. Although concerns about losing individuality often arise, it's noteworthy that what's presently lacking in schools is a genuine sense of community, which a unified, collective appearance could potentially foster. This approach could shift the focus from socio-economic disparities to shared school spirit and inclusivity. ","School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again. This provides an at least superficial equalization in our heavily economically oriented society, which may reduce discrimination of financially and/or socially disadvantaged children. Furthermore, it would facilitate the finding of truants, who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school. Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one's individuality but what's really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community, which would possibly be strengthened by an equal, collective appearance."
cap_rent_increases (en),micro_b024,"To combat unaffordable living, a cap on rent increases when changing residences is imperative. Here's why: 

* Affordable living spaces are scarce, making it difficult for individuals to find suitable housing.
* For the majority, luxury accommodations are not a necessity, but rather, **any** affordable flat is the primary goal.
* Furthermore, the average person relocates 3-10 times throughout their life due to changing accommodation needs, which exacerbates the issue of uncontrolled rent increases, highlighting the need for a protective cap.","A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences. For affordable living space is scarce. Besides, a higher degree of luxury (expensive flats) is not necessary for the majority of the people, but rather a flat at all. Plus everyone has to move approx. 3-10 times in his or her life, because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime."
health_insurance_cover_complementary_medicine (en),micro_b035,"Complementary medicine includes treatments with proven health benefits in many areas which are often less costly than medication from conventional medicine, which are also paid for after all. Often natural treatments do not put as much of a strain on the patient. Such therapies can frequently result in an improvement in the condition through the active participation of the patient. The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor's decision for natural treatment and also to cover it.","Complementary medicine encompasses treatments with empirically proven health benefits across various areas, often at a lower cost than conventional medicine, which is typically covered by insurance. Notably, natural treatments tend to be less taxing on patients. Furthermore, these therapies frequently yield improved outcomes due to the patient's active engagement. Consequently, health insurance companies should be authorized to acknowledge a doctor's prescribed natural treatment plans and provide corresponding coverage, promoting a more holistic and cost-effective approach to healthcare. "
public_broadcasting_fees_on_demand (en),micro_b014,"Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD, ZDF, Arte etc. It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees. Curiously, however, there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels. What are you paying for, then? That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations? Also the scripts are often copied off each other.","
*Actually, consideration should be given to a pay-per-view model for TV and radio licence fees, where only viewers of ARD, ZDF, Arte, etc. are required to contribute. This approach acknowledges the value of supporting high-quality programming through fees. However, the presence of advertisements and product placements on public channels raises questions about the allocation of funds. Are viewers essentially subsidizing the production of formulaic content, frequently filmed in exotic locations, and often featuring the same cast, rather than genuinely unique and innovative storytelling? A more transparent funding model could help address these concerns.*"
public_broadcasting_fees_on_demand (en),micro_k019,"The prospect of a television landscape dominated solely by private channels is unsettling. While it's true that sensational content often draws the largest audiences, catering exclusively to ratings would be misguided. Public television uniquely provides viewers with non-commercial, informative content, unswayed by profit motives. Given that societal collective financing is essential for supporting vital public goods that cannot sustain themselves in a market-driven economy, a shared contribution – such as public broadcasting fees on demand – is not only reasonable but also necessary for maintaining a well-rounded media ecosystem.","The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me. Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see. But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous. Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented. And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy, everyone should chip in."
introduce_capital_punishment (en),micro_b006,"The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany. For one thing, inviolable human dignity is anchored in our constitution, and furthermore no one may have the right to adjudicate upon the death of another human being. Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person, this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same.","The implementation of capital punishment is not feasible in Germany due to its incompatibility with the country's legal framework. Specifically, the German constitution enshrines the inviolability of human dignity, and furthermore, it establishes the principle that no individual or institution has the right to decide on the life or death of another human being. Notably, while some argue that murderers have already made life-or-death decisions, repaying such crimes with capital punishment would, paradoxically, perpetuate the very cycle of violence the law aims to condemn."
increase_weight_of_BA_thesis_in_final_grade (en),micro_b016,"The idea of the bachelor degree is to put together a cumulative grade from various individual assignments in order to generate a final grade. This is also more akin to the real working world later, where performance isn't singular, but constant and has to be delivered over longer periods. That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits). However, the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly. It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.","

The concept of a bachelor's degree is rooted in aggregating a cumulative grade from diverse individual assignments to form a comprehensive final grade. This approach mirrors the real-world work environment, where performance is consistently evaluated over extended periods, rather than being based on a single event. Consequently, it is logical that the bachelor thesis constitutes a moderate portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits), reflecting the balanced assessment of a student's overall academic journey. However, acknowledging the significant variability in effort required across equally weighted modules, it would be prudent to recalibrate the expected effort for final theses to better align with their weightage in the final grade, thereby ensuring a more equitable assessment framework. "
cap_rent_increases (en),micro_b059,"Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index. In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts, these are an unattractive investment. Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection, one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level. A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.","Rent prices are subject to existing regulations, including tenant-friendly laws and the rent index, which already provide a level of protection. Furthermore, the high purchase prices of flats with ongoing rent contracts make them unappealing investments. While additional rent control might seem necessary beyond current tenant protections, it's essential to consider the rights of long-standing property owners to adjust their returns to reflect market rates. Therefore, implementing a cap on rent increases solely upon tenant change is not justified, as it disproportionately affects landlords without addressing the broader market dynamics influencing rent prices."
higher_dog_poo_fines (en),micro_b040,"There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements. Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt, the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it. Besides, the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement, which is disproportionate. Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste, but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense.","There is a strong case for substantially increasing fines for dog owners who fail to clean up after their pets on public pavements. The unpleasant experience of stepping in dog waste not only causes immediate distress due to the mess and odor but also necessitates significant time and effort for cleanup. Moreover, the current disparity in penalties, where fines for public urination exceed those for abandoning dog waste, is unjustified. Notably, the misconception among some dog owners that their license fee implicitly covers waste disposal is a flawed analogy, as it would similarly absolve taxpayers of accountability for various infractions, highlighting the need for more stringent and logical enforcement measures."
EU_influence_on_political_events_in_Ukraine (en),micro_k016,"Despite the severe clashes in Kiev, which have at times threatened to escalate, the EU's optimal approach is non-intervention in Ukraine's internal politics. As a European country, Ukraine's pursuit of a robust democracy aligns with EU values, but any potential EU involvement must be weighed against the significant counterbalancing influence of Russia's entrenched interests in Ukrainian local politics, potentially risking escalation.","Despite the severe clashes in Kiev, which at times have threatened to escalate, the EU should not intervene in local politics. Although Ukraine is a European country, and the Ukrainian opposition is primarily interested in installing a robust democracy, possible supporters face a considerably stronger opponent in the intervention of Russia in local politics."
over_the_counter_morning_after_pill (en),micro_b042,"

The state should refrain from restricting medical products or treatments based on moral grounds, provided they do not harm others. However, omitting the prescription requirement for the morning-after pill also means forgoing pre-intake medical guidance. Given the pill's profound impact, particularly its abortive effect, dispensing it without medical counsel is inappropriate. Furthermore, unrestrained access might misleadingly position the morning-after pill as a preferable alternative to other, healthier contraceptive methods. This could lead to a decline in condom use, potentially resulting in an uptick in new AIDS infections and other sexually transmitted diseases, highlighting the need for informed medical advice to accompany access. ","The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don't do damage to others. But without a prescription requirement there's also no medical advice given before intake. Since the impact of the morning-after pill is so massive, particularly due to its abortive effect, dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate. Easy access to the morning-after pill could also result in its appearing to be an easier method than other forms of contraception that, however, have fewer health effects. For instance the morning-after pill could result in a decrease in the use of condoms and thus lead to an increase in new infections with Aids."
keep_retirement_at_63 (en),micro_k017,"The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable in Germany, given its demographic challenges. Specifically, the country faces an aging population, with a disproportionately high number of older citizens, and persistently declining birth rates. Although immigration to Germany is on the rise, the influx of newcomers alone cannot compensate for the shortage of well-qualified, younger employees essential for securing adequate pension financing in the long term.","The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable, as the population in Germany has, viewed demographically, a disproportionate number of old people, and constantly declining birth rates are being recorded. Admittedly the number of immigrants is constantly rising in Germany, but without sufficient, well-qualified junior employees there is hardly a possibility for adequate pension financing."
over_the_counter_morning_after_pill (en),micro_b055,"Being a pharmacist myself, I argue categorically in favour of over-the-counter availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies. From a medical perspective the morning-after pill works best when taken as soon as possible after intercourse. Always having to visit the doctor first (including travel and waiting time, possible embarrassment, etc.) leads to more unwanted pregnancies. Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor's and many women take it unnecessarily. However, the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors.","As a practicing pharmacist, I strongly advocate for over-the-counter (OTC) availability of the morning-after pill in pharmacies, citing compelling medical and practical benefits. 

**Timely Access**: From a medical standpoint, the morning-after pill's efficacy is significantly enhanced when administered promptly after intercourse. Mandatory doctor visits, inclusive of travel and waiting times, as well as potential embarrassment, can lead to delayed intake, thereby increasing the likelihood of unwanted pregnancies.

**Addressing Concerns about Uninformed Use**: While some argue that OTC access might bypass essential consultations and lead to unnecessary consumption, it's crucial to acknowledge that pharmacists, by law, are obligated to provide thorough patient counseling and possess subject matter expertise comparable to that of physicians. This ensures informed decision-making without the barriers associated with traditional prescription requirements."
allow_shops_to_open_on_holidays_and_sundays (en),micro_k022,"It is reasonable to argue that Sunday should retain its traditional status as a day of rest. With shops already operating for extended hours (up to 10pm) on the other six days of the week, there is ample opportunity for individuals to complete their shopping. Designating Sunday as a day exclusively for family bonding, outdoor activities, and meaningful social interactions is crucial, lest it becomes a day dominated by supermarket visits, potentially eroding community and personal well-being. Moreover, the existing six-day shopping window renders Sunday openings unnecessary, striking a balance between commerce and community needs.","It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest. For you can go shopping 6 days a week, as shops are open till 10pm on some days. Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family, otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc. Furthermore, there's no need to keep shops open on Sundays."
public_broadcasting_fees_on_demand (en),micro_k010,"Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming. In some cases there are only shows for older generations on at prime times, so why then should everyone pay for this? By now you have advertising on all channels, so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters. Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay. That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.","Considering the current television landscape, a shift to demand-based fees for public broadcasting seems justified. This approach would ensure that only those who actively engage with the programming contribute financially. A key argument in favor of this change is the observation that prime-time slots often cater to older demographics, leaving other age groups wondering why they must subsidize content not tailored to their interests. 

Moreover, the presence of advertising across all channels undermines the traditional advantage of being a paying viewer of public broadcasters. A potential counterargument is that a demand-based model might lead to a reduction in the number of available stations, given that the current broad financial base supports a diverse range of channels. However, this potential drawback is mitigated by the fact that many existing programs and stations already offer similar content, suggesting that consolidation could occur without significant loss of unique programming options."
charge_tuition_fees (en),micro_k002,"It would be justified for German universities to charge tuition fees, provided that the generated funds are directly allocated to enhance the universities' resources. This approach maintains social justice, as individuals who choose to pursue higher education can opt for student loans or scholarships to support their decision. In contrast, requiring non-academic taxpayers to subsidize others' degrees through taxation raises concerns about fairness and distributive justice, as it may disproportionately burden those who do not directly benefit from the investment in higher education.","Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees. As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice. Those who study later decide this early on, anyway. It's always possible to take out a student loan or to earn a scholarship. To oblige non-academics to finance others' degrees through taxes, however, is not just."
increase_weight_of_BA_thesis_in_final_grade (en),micro_b049,"The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme. But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis. If this carries more weight, many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured. A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher. Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role.","The bachelor thesis serves as a comprehensive reflection of both the academic content and methodologies explored throughout the degree programme. However, it is not immune to occasional errors. Assigning it excessive weight in the final grade risks overshadowing the cumulative effort and achievement demonstrated through consistently strong individual assignments completed during the programme. Moreover, the quality of a thesis can be significantly influenced by the calibre of supervision provided by the assigned teacher, introducing an element of variability. Considering these factors, it is reasonable to suggest that the weight of the bachelor thesis in the final grade should be reassessed to strike a more balanced evaluation of a student's overall academic performance."
