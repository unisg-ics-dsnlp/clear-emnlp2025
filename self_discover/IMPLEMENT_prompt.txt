Operationalize the reasoning modules into a step-by-step reasoning plan in JSON format:

Example task:
[REASONING EXAMPLE]

Example plan for the example task:
[REASONING EXAMPLE PLAN]

Modules:
[MODULES]

Examples:
[EXAMPLES]

Implement a reasoning structure for solvers to follow step-by-step and arrive at correct answers. Do not solve the examples, just output the generated plan:
