"It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.
To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.
Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.
Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.","

It is undeniable that modern society is grappling with an array of novel health problems and ailments unprecedented in the past. While many attribute this trend to a sedentary lifestyle, I concur that inactivity plays a significant role but argue that other factors have an even more profound impact.

Initially, I acknowledge the detrimental effects of a sedentary lifestyle on health. The primary driver behind this phenomenon is the advent of advanced technology. Historically, entertainment options were limited and often required physical engagement, leading to more outdoor activities. In contrast, today, particularly in urban settings, individuals spend considerable time engrossed in screens, from TVs to digital devices.

However, there are additional, equally compelling reasons behind the surge in serious medical issues. Firstly, the modern environment is markedly polluted, with elevated greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful gases, leading to widespread health problems such as allergies. Secondly, the proliferation of low-quality foods, including fast food, junk food, and genetically modified products, has a profoundly negative impact on health. Lastly, the stress levels in contemporary life have escalated due to recent challenges like traffic congestion, accidents, and related issues.

In light of these findings, it is evident that the emergence of various recent illnesses can be attributed to the cumulative effect of these factors, with sedentary lifestyle being just one piece of the puzzle.@

"Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.
The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.
Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.
Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.
In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.","
Gun control remains a contentious issue globally, with regulations varying significantly across countries. From my perspective, stringent gun control is a prudent approach.

**Enhancing Public Safety: Reducing Accidental Discharges**
While licensing is in place, accidental gun-related incidents still occur, as evidenced by periodic hunting mishaps. Logically, minimizing the number of guns in circulation would lead to fewer accidents, resulting in safer environments with notably lower incident rates.

**Mitigating the Nexus Between Gun Availability and Violent Crime**
A significant proportion of violent offenses, particularly in countries with lax gun laws, involve firearm misuse. If unchecked, this trend could cultivate a more violent societal landscape. For instance, the ease of access to guns in the United States has led to devastating school shootings involving young adults and juveniles. Furthermore, the possession of advanced weaponry by terrorists poses a constant threat to citizen safety.

**The Alarming Link Between Gun Ownership and Suicide Rates**
In the US, firearms are the leading method of suicide, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Disconcertingly, there's an upward trend in suicides among adolescents and the elderly (75+ years). This correlation underscores the need for stricter gun control.

**Conclusion**
Given the compelling evidence linking gun availability to increased accident rates, violent crime, and suicide rates, I firmly advocate for the strict limitation of guns and the implementation of comprehensive governmental regulations to safeguard our societies from the perils of unchecked firearm access.

"It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.
In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.
Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.
Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.
To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.","

It is rare to find a home without a television, with the number of channels and programs increasing exponentially. Unfortunately, most people lack a plan to limit or schedule their TV time. I concur with the notion that television erodes family bonds and social connections.

Firstly, watching television is an insidiously time-consuming activity. The proliferation of new channels and shows can lead to mindless channel-surfing, leaving us with no time for other activities by day's end. A common problem we all face is having no time to connect with loved ones, such as making calls to parents or friends, due to the hours spent in front of the TV.

Secondly, excessive television watching fosters laziness. After an 8-hour workday, spending at least three hours in front of the TV can preclude engaging in healthy activities like exercising at the gym or playing sports. This sedentary lifestyle preference can transform individuals into inactive, anti-social beings who opt for TV over human interaction.

Lastly, certain TV programs have a deleterious impact on viewers, particularly teenagers. Some thriller or action movies glorify criminal activities, which can inspire young viewers to mimic such behaviors in their daily lives, highlighting the need for responsible content regulation.

In conclusion, the destructive nature of television is multifaceted, encompassing time wastage, the promotion of laziness, and the dissemination of negative behaviors. Addressing this global issue necessitates a collective effort to find a solution, emphasizing the importance of balanced TV consumption and the revival of meaningful human connections.

"Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.
Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.
Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.
Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.
Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.","
Education is pivotal for global development, and a contentious issue surrounding this is whether universities should maintain a balanced gender ratio in their admissions. I firmly argue that universities should accept an equal number of males and females in each course, based on their preferences and merits.

The right to education is a fundamental human right, universally applicable to both genders. In pursuit of women's empowerment, a key global objective, providing equal opportunities for females alongside males is crucial. By admitting students in equal numbers, universities foster a healthy competitive environment where both genders can nurture their talents, promoting overall growth.

Co-educational settings facilitate interpersonal skills development between genders, teaching them to collaborate effectively. For instance, single-sex colleges often leave students unprepared for interactions with the opposite sex, a limitation that co-education resolves. By offering equal opportunities, universities prepare students for future challenges, yielding long-term benefits.

Unfortunately, gender biases persist, with some believing women are less capable in fields like mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. However, history refutes this, with figures like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Marie Curie exemplifying women's intellectual prowess across various disciplines.

In conclusion, I strongly believe in the equal rights of both genders to education. Universities admitting students in equal numbers, based on merit and choice, will significantly contribute to societal development. Both genders are integral to society's fabric, neither superior nor inferior. The choice of course should be determined by individual merit, irrespective of gender, to ensure equitable educational rights for all.

"Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.
First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.
Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.
In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.","

Due to the ubiquity of modern technology, the traditional office boundaries have dissolved, prompting the debate: is working from home with a computer and phone more effective than working at a company's office? In my opinion, working at home is less efficient than working in an office setting.

**Advantages of Office Work Environment**

Firstly, in-office collaboration enables instantaneous interaction among colleagues, facilitating seamless assistance and discussions. For instance, when working on a large project, team members can swiftly convene to share new ideas, promoting efficiency and direct communication. Moreover, technical issues can be promptly resolved with the support of in-house MIS staff.

**Drawbacks of Remote Work**

Conversely, working from home is plagued by distractions that inevitably hinder productivity. The ease of accessing entertainment (e.g., TV) and snacks can erode focus. Moreover, the lack of supervision increases the likelihood of procrastination. Additionally, remote workers often miss crucial office events, such as important announcements from management, which can lead to feelings of disconnection.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, working in an office surpasses working from home in terms of efficiency. The office environment offers the dual benefits of collaborative teamwork and a structured atmosphere, which are indispensable for optimal productivity and cannot be fully replicated in a home setting.

Moreover, the lack of supervision increases the likelihood of procrastination. Additionally, remote workers often miss crucial office events, such as important announcements from management, which can lead to feelings of disconnection.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, working in an office surpasses working from home in terms of efficiency. The office environment offers the dual benefits of collaborative teamwork and a structured atmosphere, which are indispensable for optimal productivity and cannot be fully replicated in a home setting. "
"Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.
First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.
However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.
In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.","
Nowadays, the omnipresence of advertisements across various media platforms, including newspapers, radio, and television, has sparked a heated debate about its impact on society. While some argue that advertising brings numerous benefits, others vehemently disagree. This argument will examine both perspectives before arriving at a well-reasoned conclusion.

**The Case for Advertising as a Positive Force**

Primarily, advertising serves to promote products and services, thereby driving sales and profits for businesses. Consumers also reap benefits, as advertisements inform them about current offers, enabling informed decisions. For instance, telecommunications customers can compare internet and mobile phone plans from various companies, making advertising a valuable resource. These advantages lend significant credence to the notion that advertising positively impacts lives.

**Counterarguments: The Negative Consequences of Advertising**

Conversely, critics argue that advertising has detrimental effects. Notably, the proliferation of automated, unwanted advertisements (spam) to personal phones and email addresses causes widespread discomfort and annoyance. Furthermore, advertising campaigns can be exorbitantly expensive, with no guarantee of success, thereby imposing a substantial financial burden on businesses.

**Conclusion**

Upon weighing the pros and cons, while both viewpoints hold merit, the benefits of advertising appear to outweigh its drawbacks. Ultimately, the positive influence of advertising on both businesses and consumers tips the balance, lending stronger support to the argument that advertising is, indeed, a positive aspect of modern life.

"The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.
First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.
On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.
Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. 
To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.","

The allocation of government funds to aesthetic features versus public services has sparked intense debate. While some argue that investing in the arts is a misallocation of national resources, better spent on public services, I firmly believe that supporting the arts is in the best interest of society.

Firstly, governments undoubtedly bear the responsibility of providing efficient public services, ensuring citizens' basic needs in healthcare, education, transportation, and communication are met. However, these provisions only cater to physical requirements, overlooking the crucial aspect of mental health initiatives, which the arts subtly yet effectively address.

Moreover, the arts are indispensable to a society's holistic development. Notably, every developed nation prioritizes music, painting, literature, and other art forms, recognizing their profound impact on enriching lives, broadening perspectives, and driving societal advancement in myriad positive ways.

Additionally, investing in the arts can generate employment opportunities and potentially yield returns. The created artworks, considered national treasures, can appreciate in value, effectively reimbursing the initial investment. This dual benefit underscores the economic viability of arts funding.

In conclusion, far from being a wasteful expenditure, investing in the arts enriches a society's culture, yielding multifaceted benefits for both governments and individuals, thereby justifying its place alongside public services in national budget allocations.",essay131.txt,The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts,direct,essay,"

"The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. 
Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. 
Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. 
Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. 
Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.","

The city that resonates with me the most is one that masterfully blends the richness of history with the vibrancy of modernity. Unfortunately, my birth city, once a testament to antique beauty with its plethora of ancient-style buildings, has largely lost this charm to the relentless tide of urbanization. Today, remnants of those classic structures are mostly confined to photographs and museum exhibits. To prevent the wholesale disappearance of historic buildings, some advocate for government investment in their preservation. I firmly believe it is our collective responsibility to safeguard these architectural treasures, ensuring future generations can marvel at them. Here are key reasons and examples underscoring my perspective.

Historic buildings hold intrinsic value as seminal symbols of a city's identity. They serve as tangible links to a city's cultural heritage and historical complexity. Witnessing these buildings, whether they're renowned or simply poignant, allows individuals to connect with the aesthetic and cultural lineage of an area. For instance, the mere mention of Beijing, China's capital, inevitably conjures images of the Forbidden City, an iconic emblem not just of the city, but of China's collective history. The study of the Forbidden City provides researchers with a comprehensive window into the nation's past and cultural fabric.

Moreover, historic buildings enrich our lives by offering serene oases amidst the hustle and bustle. Cities, often dominated by modern high-rises and crowded spaces, can feel suffocating. In contrast, the warmth and character of historic materials like heart pine, marble, or vintage brick evoke a sense of inner peace. Simple moments, such as lounging under the roof of a historic building or sitting at a desk steeped in history, provide effortless escapes from life's annoyances, fostering a profound sense of tranquility.

Notably, historic buildings can also serve as self-sustaining economic entities. Landmarks like the Forbidden City and the Shanghai Art Museum attract tens of thousands of tourists, generating substantial revenue through admission fees. This model of financial self-sufficiency, welcomed by governments for its efficiency, can be replicated in numerous cities, showcasing the economic viability of preserving our cultural heritage.

In conclusion, my ideal city is an exquisite blend of historical depth and modern flair. However, the preservation of old buildings is an irreversible endeavor - once lost, they cannot be restored. This stark reality underscores the paramount importance of identifying and safeguarding historically significant sites. Therefore, I strongly advocate for government investment in the preservation of our architectural legacy.

"With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.
To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.
Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.
It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.
In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.","
With the rapid advancement in information technology, long-distance education has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional schooling, sparking a debate about its relative benefits. In my opinion, I firmly believe that distance-learning surpasses traditional education in providing more comprehensive benefits to students.

**Primarily, distance-learning offers unparalleled convenience and cost-effectiveness**. By leveraging an internet connection, students can significantly reduce expenses associated with commuting, tuition, and textbooks. This is particularly advantageous for rural students and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who can now access quality education without geographical or financial constraints.

**Moreover, online education platforms provide unparalleled access to diverse knowledge resources and personalized learning approaches**. With just a click, students can tap into a vast array of study materials, including scientific reports, academic journals, and documentaries. Furthermore, learners can handpick online courses tailored to their interests, schedules, and learning pace, fostering a self-directed and fulfilling educational experience.

**Although traditional education excels in face-to-face interaction, instantaneous feedback, and holistic development**, advancements in streaming and sensor technologies have largely bridged the gap in remote education. These innovations now enable seamless communication, virtual collaboration, and immersive learning experiences, effectively mitigating the drawbacks of physical distance.

**In conclusion, while acknowledging the inherent merits of traditional education, I assert that distance-learning offers a more compelling proposition**. Its triple advantages of efficiency, convenience, and economic viability, combined with the empowerment of self-regulated learning, make it an increasingly attractive and effective alternative to conventional schooling, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience for students worldwide.
