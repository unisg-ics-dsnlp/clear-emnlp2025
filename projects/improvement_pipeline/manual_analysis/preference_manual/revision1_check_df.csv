"What once seemed like a faraway science fiction fantasy is now becoming a reality. Testing of self-driving cars is happening right here and now in our city of Pittsburgh. As technology advances and becomes ever more a part of our daily lives, we must consider the consequences of embracing the shiny and new. Though there are risks associated with adopting self-driving car technology into our society, the benefits of doing so greatly outweigh the risks.

Have you ever been trapped in an unnecessary traffic slowdown? Have you thought about how much time and gas you could save if the roadways and cars operated more efficiently and safely? Have you ever been concerned about public safety because of dangerous drivers who may be distracted, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise impaired? All of these problems could be solved with self-driving cars. The widespread use of self-driving cars could improve efficiency and safety of roadways, free up time and resources for members of society, and eliminate the human error that results in needless car accidents each year.

If self-driving cars ruled the roadway, your riding experience would be much more enjoyable. When self-driving cars communicate and work together on the road, they are able to improve traffic conditions and congestion. They are also able to identify road risks early on to avoid further frustration during your ride. The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient, not to mention safer! Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road. Though this is a legitimate concern, it should be tempered with the knowledge that methods for hacking prevention are on the rise since this is a concern in all technological aspects of our lives like our personal computers and cell phones.

Self-driving cars also reduce commute times and would maximize gasoline usage. This would create more free time in the lives of drivers and passengers everywhere. Not only would it create time directly through commute reduction, but it would also potentially allow drivers to spend time in the car doing other things like reading or talking with other passengers, since their attention may not need to be on the road. It could be argued that drivers will still need to maintain focus while riding in self-driving cars. This may be true initially, but as the technology improves and becomes more widespread, passive driving will become a reality. Reduced costs associated with gasoline are just an added benefit for society!

When it comes down to it, human error is the source of difficulties with driving. Traffic, congestion, and car accidents are all a result of humans being imperfect drivers. Self-driving cars would take human error out of the picture, preventing distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers from causing fatal car accidents. Though there is always the small risk of mechanical failure to result in an accident, this risk is minute compared to the risk of humans being behind the wheel. 

Accepting new technology into our society should not be done hastily, but self-driving car technology is one that will improve our lives. With self-driving cars, we will have better driving experiences, we will have more time, and we will be safer.","As we witness the transformation of science fiction into reality, self-driving car testing is underway in our city of Pittsburgh, prompting us to weigh the consequences of embracing this innovation. While risks are associated with adopting self-driving car technology, a thorough analysis reveals that the benefits substantially outweigh them.

"Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and give opportunities to many people who can't travel by themselves at this moment. On the other hand, people also raise concerns about the security, safety, and economy of the technology.
In my opinion, I support bringing self-driving cars into reality. The technology can bring many benefits to humanity. First, we, as human in modern societies, will save a lot of money thanks to the technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and they can communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Second, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it can eliminate mistakes made by a human. The most common mistake is driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tireness). Moreover, drivers tend to have false confidence as they have more driving hours. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Last but not least, self-driving cars put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, in many cases, they can only take a person to a pre-designated location (stop) rather than the real destination. Public transportations are operated with a fixed schedule which does not perfectly match everyone's situations. 
The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: not-ready and not-true. The not-ready group contains arguments about new challenges that the technology will bring in when it is deployed in mass. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? Or security issues such as how can drivers protect their personal data and what will happen if the car is hijacked by a hi-tech criminal? Interestingly, what would the car-makers or software designers choose in moral-sensitive situations? For example, given an unavoidable accident will happen, which will either kill an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement, which choice should be made by the self-driving car? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. The not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuffs. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. I use the washing machine at least twice a week without knowing how to make such a machine. Another false opinion is the difference between states regarding turning right on red or cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. In fact, the car can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. Moreover, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, the police officer does not need to go down the street and directs the traffic but just sends information to the car through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs a manufacturer. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.
In conclusion, I think self-driving car is a revolution that will have more benefit to our society. However, there are still some concerns needed to be addressed in order to make this technology available to everyone.","

Self-driving cars have lately sparked intense debates. On one hand, they offer numerous benefits, including enhanced safety, cost savings, and increased mobility for those currently unable to travel independently. On the other hand, concerns about security, safety, and economic impact are also raised.

In my opinion, implementing self-driving cars is a step in the right direction. This technology can significantly benefit humanity in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to substantial cost savings for individuals in modern societies. With the ability of self-driving cars to communicate, they can mitigate congestion and navigate through unknown traffic conditions more effectively. Secondly, by eliminating human error—the primary cause of accidents, including those due to driving under the influence or fatigue—self-driving cars enhance road safety. Additionally, the confidence that comes with experience, which can paradoxically increase the risk of accidents, is also averted. Lastly, self-driving cars provide equitable mobility for individuals with travel difficulties, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which often has fixed routes and schedules that may not cater to everyone's needs, self-driving cars can offer door-to-door service.

Concerns about self-driving cars can be categorized into 'implementation challenges' and 'misconceptions'. Implementation challenges include unanswered questions about responsibility in the event of an accident, data security, potential hijacking, and moral dilemmas in unavoidable accidents. These issues must be addressed before mass deployment. Misconceptions, on the other hand, include the assumption that drivers will lose operational skills (similar to how we use daily appliances without fully understanding their mechanics), concerns about adapting to state-specific traffic laws (easily resolved through GPS-based algorithm updates), and fears about reduced car sales for manufacturers (which is unlikely as self-driving cars still require manufacturing, as evidenced by the growing number of car manufacturers, including Volvo, BMW, Toyota, and Honda, entering the self-driving market).

In conclusion, I firmly believe that self-driving cars represent a revolutionary step forward for our society, offering numerous benefits. However, it is crucial that we address the outstanding concerns to ensure this technology is accessible and beneficial to everyone.",draft1_2018argrewrite_2.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently.

"Many of car accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving. Self-driving cars might not be the answer. 

Equipped with multiple sensors and advanced algorithms, a self-driving car is more likely to be an ideal driver; a self-driving car is more accurate, reliable, and focused than a human driver. However, engineers are still researching the self-driving technology. Many practical questions need be answered. For example, who will  drive the car if the technology fails? This op-ed article will convince you that we should not use self-driving cars. 

First, like human, technology could fail. Who will shoulder the responsibility of driving when the technology fails? We know that there is a big circulating head on top of a self-driving car. It is the “eye” and “ear” of the car. When a human driver is  navigating through a storm, they use their senses to make informed decisions. However, in extreme conditions, the “eye and the “ear” of the car might be damaged. A “blind” driver cannot safely operate a car. In addition, self-driving cars might discourage prospective drivers from attending driver’s education courses. In the case of failed technology, unskilled human operators are not ready to shoulder the responsibility of driving, and there are consequences. 

Who should be responsible for the consequences caused by a malfunctioning self-driving car? When a self-driving car malfunctions, the people inside of the car may not be able to gain control quickly. The time lapsed between a mechanical failure and an attempt to gain control over the car might be long enough to cause an accident. In a court of law, it is very difficult to determine who is responsible in this case. We do not want accidents; we want reliable technology.

Proponents of self-driving cars argue that self-driving cars reduce the cost of driving and alleviate societal burden. On the contrary, the cost of self-driving cars is much high than expected.The research dollars that companies now poured into testings will be paid by the consumers in the long run. In addition, self-driving cars are equipped with sensors that carry a high maintenance and replacement fee. A self-driving car is still a luxury for the general public. The benefits of self-driving cars cannot be reaped if they are not widely used. Additionally, unemployment rates would roar for the transportation industry because machines will replace human labors. The gasoline industry will also suffer immensely since self-driving cars are very likely to be electric.","

Furthermore, the potential for self-driving cars to discourage prospective drivers from attending driver's education courses poses a significant risk. In the event of technological failure, unskilled human operators may be unable to assume responsibility, leading to severe consequences.

**Accountability in the Event of Malfunction**
Determining responsibility for accidents caused by malfunctioning self-driving cars is a complex issue. The time lag between mechanical failure and attempted human intervention may be sufficient to cause an accident. In a court of law, attributing blame is exceedingly challenging. Our primary goal is reliable technology, not increased litigation.

**Economic and Societal Implications**
Proponents argue that self-driving cars reduce driving costs and alleviate societal burdens. Conversely, the true cost of self-driving cars far exceeds initial expectations. The substantial research investments made by companies will ultimately be passed on to consumers. Moreover, the high maintenance and replacement costs of sensors make self-driving cars a luxury item for the general public. Widespread adoption, necessary to reap the benefits, is unlikely in the near future.

"Not having to worry about paying attention while driving is cool, but dying because your computerized, self-driven car made a mistake is not.

Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan and California are testing cars with artificial intelligence, and they're proving that the hassle creates more danger than the convenience is worth. While it's shown that self-driving cars can prevent accidents caused by human drivers, they don't completely eliminate them and in fact, offer their own set of safety hazards.

According to Auto Insurance Center, ""The very security behind self-driving cars would be a major obstacle, especially because the technology would be of very high interest to
hackers.""

While car accidents account for a large portion of deaths in the United States, adding the unpredictability of self-driving cars' capabilities for safe driving — as well as the possibility for hackers to cause accidents — only make matters more hazardous for everyone on the road.

In addition to this new technology being dangerous for everyone involved, and even those that aren't, it would also be very expensive to implement. All current human-driven vehicles would need to be replaced, which requires workers to scrap the old cars and build new ones. additional training would be necessary for users to understand the self-driving cars and what to do in an emergency.

""While the computer takes over once the vehicle is operational, the driver would still be required to maintain some knowledge about how to operate it safely,"" Auto Insurance Center said.

An important counterpoint for the dangers of autonomous vehicles is that they can significantly help the lives of people with disabilities by providing transportation that is easily accessible. Current public transportation methods, while allowing individuals to not have to drive themselves, still exclude those with certain disabilities and are less convenient.

The same safety problems still apply to individuals with disabilities, of course, and may even affect them more. If an autonomous car were to get in an accident with a disabled passenger, they may not be able to save themselves from the crash or even call to get help.

In general, self-driving cars will be more of a hindrance to society than a help. Not only would they present danger to everyone on the road, they would be too expensive to use world- or even country-wide. Time and energy is better spent improving current human-driven cars as well as creating programs to better educate drivers.","

Not having to worry about driving can be appealing, but the risks associated with self-driving cars outweigh this convenience. Several states, including Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, and California, are testing AI-powered vehicles, revealing that the drawbacks pose a greater threat than the benefits.

While self-driving cars can mitigate accidents caused by human error, they don't eliminate them entirely and introduce new safety concerns. According to the Auto Insurance Center, the security of self-driving cars is a significant vulnerability, particularly due to the high interest from hackers.

The implementation of self-driving cars would exacerbate the existing hazard of car accidents in the US, which already account for a substantial number of fatalities. The unpredictability of these vehicles, coupled with the risk of hacking, increases the danger for all road users.

Moreover, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars would be prohibitively expensive. The replacement of all current vehicles would require significant resources, including workforce relocation, scrapping of old cars, and manufacturing of new ones. Additionally, users would need specialized training to operate these vehicles safely, as noted by the Auto Insurance Center, which states, ""Drivers would still need to maintain knowledge on safe operation, even after the computer takes control.""

A notable counterargument is that autonomous vehicles can greatly enhance the lives of people with disabilities by providing accessible transportation. However, this demographic would also be more susceptible to the inherent safety risks, potentially facing greater challenges in responding to emergencies or seeking help in the event of an accident.

Ultimately, self-driving cars are likely to hinder societal progress more than facilitate it.

Instead, efforts should focus on enhancing existing human-driven vehicles and developing driver education programs to improve road safety. ",draft1_2018argrewrite_74.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"Not having to worry about paying attention while driving is cool, but dying because your computerized, self-driven car made a mistake is not.

Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan and California are testing cars with artificial intelligence, and they're proving that the hassle creates more danger than the convenience is worth. While it's shown that self-driving cars can prevent accidents caused by human drivers, they don't completely eliminate them and in fact, offer their own set of safety hazards.

According to Auto Insurance Center, ""The very security behind self-driving cars would be a major obstacle, especially because the technology would be of very high interest to
hackers.""

While car accidents account for a large portion of deaths in the United States, adding the unpredictability of self-driving cars' capabilities for safe driving — as well as the possibility for hackers to cause accidents — only make matters more hazardous for everyone on the road.

In addition to this new technology being dangerous for everyone involved, and even those that aren't, it would also be very expensive to implement. All current human-driven vehicles would need to be replaced, which requires workers to scrap the old cars and build new ones. additional training would be necessary for users to understand the self-driving cars and what to do in an emergency.

""While the computer takes over once the vehicle is operational, the driver would still be required to maintain some knowledge about how to operate it safely,"" Auto Insurance Center said.

An important counterpoint for the dangers of autonomous vehicles is that they can significantly help the lives of people with disabilities by providing transportation that is easily accessible. Current public transportation methods, while allowing individuals to not have to drive themselves, still exclude those with certain disabilities and are less convenient.

The same safety problems still apply to individuals with disabilities, of course, and may even affect them more. If an autonomous car were to get in an accident with a disabled passenger, they may not be able to save themselves from the crash or even call to get help.

In general, self-driving cars will be more of a hindrance to society than a help. Not only would they present danger to everyone on the road, they would be too expensive to use world- or even country-wide. Time and energy is better spent improving current human-driven cars as well as creating programs to better educate drivers.","

Not having to worry about driving can be appealing, but the risks associated with self-driving cars outweigh this convenience. Several states, including Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, and California, are testing AI-powered vehicles, revealing that the drawbacks pose a greater threat than the benefits.

While self-driving cars can mitigate accidents caused by human error, they don't eliminate them entirely and introduce new safety concerns. According to the Auto Insurance Center, the security of self-driving cars is a significant vulnerability, particularly due to the high interest from hackers.

The implementation of self-driving cars would exacerbate the existing hazard of car accidents in the US, which already account for a substantial number of fatalities. The unpredictability of these vehicles, coupled with the risk of hacking, increases the danger for all road users.

Moreover, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars would be prohibitively expensive. The replacement of all current vehicles would require significant resources, including workforce relocation, scrapping of old cars, and manufacturing of new ones. Additionally, users would need specialized training to operate these vehicles safely, as noted by the Auto Insurance Center, which states, ""Drivers would still need to maintain knowledge on safe operation, even after the computer takes control.""

A notable counterargument is that autonomous vehicles can greatly enhance the lives of people with disabilities by providing accessible transportation. However, this demographic would also be more susceptible to the inherent safety risks, potentially facing greater challenges in responding to emergencies or seeking help in the event of an accident.

Ultimately, self-driving cars are likely to hinder societal progress more than facilitate it. The dangers they pose to all road users, combined with the exorbitant costs of implementation, make them a less desirable solution. Instead, efforts should focus on enhancing existing human-driven vehicles and developing driver education programs to improve road safety. "
"Up with Self-Driving Cars and Down with Gasoline Industry
     Self-driving cars will eliminate many accidents and the gasoline industry which causes too much pollution and whose time has run out. The computer running the car won’t be distracted like humans. The average attention span is only eight seconds so a person might not respond fast enough to a deer in the headlights or a bicyclist going past. Human error causes 94% of traffic accidents. Most traffic accidents are caused by drunk and distracted driving.
     A self-driving car will prevent many accidents especially ones caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk or text on their cell phones, eat and drink, talk to people in their vehicle, or play with the radio/CD player while driving which is highly dangerous. Children, pets, conversations, and preoccupations such as applying makeup can distract a driver.
    Other causes of accidents such as speeding, drunk or reckless driving, running red lights, running stop signs, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving will be eliminated. 
     A self-driving car will probably be electric and electric cars will be better for the environment. Electric cars are more efficient and generate less pollution. An electric car is very quiet and very smooth compared to gas operated cars which are clunky and outdated. Electric cars are cheaper to operate so have a big cost advantage over gas. Electric cars are also more efficient so cost about one-third to one-quarter the cost of gasoline. Maintenance costs are less since electric cars don’t need oil changes. Since electric cars don’t have a tailpipe they will improve the air quality.
     Gas cars pollute the atmosphere so it’s time we eliminate or lessen the gasoline industry so we can breathe healthier air. High levels of chemicals taken in from gasoline exposure like benzene may cause cancer. The inhalation of fumes can lead to confusion, dizziness, headaches and breathing difficulties. Using gasoline is bad since it relies on fossil fuels which are in short supply and dwindling. Therefore it’s time we switched to electric cars.
     The mechanics in gas garages can be trained to work on electric cars instead or for other jobs. When we switched from the horse and buggy to cars we didn’t worry about the people who raised horses losing jobs. We can’t let that stop inevitable progress. People who don’t own cars will still ride the buses and take taxis so those operating the vehicles will still have jobs.","Embracing Self-Driving Cars and Reducing Reliance on the Gasoline Industry

Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize transportation by significantly decreasing accidents and mitigating the environmental impact of the gasoline industry, which has become a substantial pollutant. Unlike humans, who are prone to distractions, the computer operating the vehicle remains focused. Notably, the average human attention span of just eight seconds can lead to delayed reactions to unexpected obstacles, such as deer or bicyclists. Human error, responsible for approximately 94% of traffic accidents, is largely attributed to distracted, drunk, or reckless driving.

The adoption of self-driving cars is expected to drastically reduce accidents, particularly those caused by distracted driving. Common distractions like using cell phones, eating, conversing with passengers, or adjusting the radio can be eliminated. Additionally, self-driving cars will likely prevent accidents resulting from speeding, drunk driving, ignoring traffic signals, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving.

Moreover, self-driving cars will probably operate on electric power, offering numerous environmental benefits. Electric vehicles (EVs) are more efficient, producing significantly less pollution. They provide a smoother, quieter ride compared to traditional gas-operated cars, which are becoming outdated. The cost advantages of EVs are substantial, with operating costs estimated to be one-third to one-quarter of those for gasoline-powered vehicles. Maintenance is also reduced, as EVs do not require oil changes, and the absence of tailpipes improves air quality.

The gasoline industry's detrimental effects on air quality, including the emission of carcinogenic chemicals like benzene, can be mitigated by transitioning to electric cars. The inhalation of gasoline fumes can lead to various health issues, and the reliance on dwindling fossil fuels is unsustainable. 

While this shift may necessitate the retraining of mechanics from gas garages to work on electric vehicles or adapt to new roles, history has shown that technological progress often requires workforce adjustments. The transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles serves as a precedent, where the focus was on embracing innovation rather than preserving outdated industries. Furthermore, public transportation services, such as buses and taxis, will continue to operate, ensuring employment opportunities for drivers.",draft1_2018argrewrite_28.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"Up with Self-Driving Cars and Down with Gasoline Industry

"3. am in the morning after drinking with your best friends at junior high, you are exhausted, lost, and drunk in the middle of nowhere. You want to drive back home but that is just too dangerous. A self-driving car can take you home safely. This is a rather new area and quite debatable. How can we make sure that robots will solve all the complicated situation on the roads? What if there are other humans involved, such as other drivers or police giving signals? Most importantly, how can we use it? Indeed, there are many uncertainties related to self-driving cars but overall it is a promising topic. Self-driving cars can avoid distractions, help elder and disabled people to drive car and save energy and time.

First of all, let us address the doubt of the self-driving algorithm. Even though the situation on the road is unpredictable, many situations can be highly generalized. For example, if the sensor noticed something in the front, regardless of whether it is a furry cat or grumpy grandpa, it will stop at once. The same principal applies to other human drivers around. Moreover, learning to drive itself is difficult for many people. Learning how to tell a robot to drive should not be harder than that.

Human drivers can be easily distracted. “Many of [traffic] accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving.” However, it is much harder to get a computer lost in the beautiful view along the road. In this case, AI is much more accurate than human. Human drivers maybe drunk or affected by drugs. They may also be affected by their mood, from depression to ecstasy. They may also busy with talking to their passengers. If Al is in charge, human can spend less time in driving and more time in focusing their own career, which is beneficial for them as well.

Additionally, many people rely heavily on public transportation or other people in their family in order to travel. This is because they cannot drive on their own due to physical limitation. However, not everyone has time to pick them up. Especially when we are entering the era that more and more elder people are around. I was forced to wait for my grandmother and drive her to her home in the childhood. This not only spend much time of mine which I could have spent in other places, but also my grandmother can only travel once every week because my father is too busy to drive her one more time. Just imagine how much benefit self-driving car will bring to us. 

Moreover, AI can calculate the best route. In our class, we learn about minimal spending tree and many other algorithms to find the shortest route. However, not many people will apply graph theory before they drive. Therefore, using a self-driver can make sure that they find the best possible way to go to school or company. This will save the amount of time they spend on the road and save gasoline as well. This will protect our environment too.","

"The growth of technology and machines has been at its panache in the 21st century. Humans have found a way to automate every possible task using the availability of high computing power and highly sophisticated algorithms. Driving has been a passion for some and mundane task for others but it has been an important skill for some time now. In recent time, we have also seen improvement in road infrastructure and that has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane job which we need to do compute on daily basis. Such technology can help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for whom this more like a job than a passion or a choice. Though I strongly advocate the research in this area, I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles.
Most of us millennials like me started driving at an early age, growing worldwide economy can cheaper cars have helped the gap and luxury to drive a car in recent time. Self-driving cars which can drastically reduce the effort required in driving can be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure and road. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are a symbol of personal freedom. The United States as per my understanding cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars. The success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.
Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in the middle age and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into the more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program. 
Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can lead to major issues and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator to understand the issue and can lead to major accidents within seconds due to lack of manual control. Himalayan roads where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of any malfunction.
In conclusion, self-driving vehicles is a great idea but are limited to multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs. Such implementation is not a very feasible idea the grand scale but can be used where we can easily meet all the constraints.","

"Self-driving cars might still sound like something from a sci-fi story, but these automobiles are finding their way onto the road more and more. Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.

According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. 

While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.

Self-driving cars also have the potential to save lives. They rectify the lingering issue of drunk or drug-influenced drivers who should not be operating normal motor vehicles. These advanced cars would also decrease distracted drivers or tired drivers on the road. This article cites the CDC and points out that “fatalities from traffic accidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people.” All of the impaired drivers mentioned previously contribute to this statistic. But when unsafe drivers are taken out of the driver’s seat, the overall safety of people everywhere increases.

While there will always be the “what ifs” of self-driving cars, we can’t let that stop us from innovating. With self-driving cars, commuters and pedestrians gain an increased sense of security and well-being.","

Self-driving cars, once relegated to the realm of science fiction, are increasingly becoming a reality on our roads. Pioneering companies like Google are tirelessly refining self-driving technologies to mitigate human error and enhance transportation efficiency. As with all breakthroughs, the deployment of self-driving cars sparks debate about their advantages and disadvantages.

According to the Auto Insurance Center's article, “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars,” there are numerous points of contention on both sides. The primary argument in favor of self-driving cars is their potential to drastically reduce human-related driving errors, thereby increasing transportation efficiency. With the burden of speed management and situational awareness lifted, drivers can enjoy unparalleled freedom, whether they have a disability or are temporarily incapacitated. This could notably enhance the overall quality of life for users of self-driving transportation. Notably, many drivers have already adapted to preliminary self-driving features like autonomous braking, self-parking, and obstacle detection sensors. Conversely, the counterargument centers on the relinquishment of autonomy in favor of technological reliance, which, like all technology, is susceptible to failure via short-circuiting, hacking, or human interference.

Despite the understandable hesitation towards a future dominated by autonomous vehicles, the benefits unequivocally outweigh the drawbacks. At its core, self-driving cars epitomize technological innovation, aimed at elevating life quality and streamlining daily tasks. By alleviating the stress of potential driving mishaps, self-driving cars enable passengers to focus on other pressing matters. This technology also liberates individuals reliant on public transport or personal assistance, including those with physical or mental disabilities who can now travel independently. Although cost is a concern, ongoing developments will inevitably lead to more economical production methods, making self-driving cars accessible to all.

Moreover, self-driving cars hold the potential to save countless lives by addressing the persistent issue of impaired drivers. They would significantly reduce the number of fatalities resulting from distracted, tired, or intoxicated drivers. Citing the CDC, the annual toll of over 33,000 traffic accident fatalities would decrease substantially with the removal of unsafe drivers from the equation, thereby enhancing overall safety.

While uncertainties surrounding self-driving cars will persist, they should not hinder innovation. Ultimately, the adoption of self-driving cars will yield increased security and well-being for both commuters and pedestrians, marking a pivotal step forward in transportation evolution. ",draft1_2018argrewrite_84.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"Self-driving cars might still sound like something from a sci-fi story, but these automobiles are finding their way onto the road more and more. Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.

According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. 

While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.

"The self-driving car is a groundbreaking piece of technology. There is no doubt about that. However, I really question how feasible it is to transition them into every day life in America. The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible: safer driving via decreased accidents, the inability for a computer to get distracted, identifying traffic problems and no longer needing a designated driver, saving money, and saving time. On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening as they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered and jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer. In other words, there is no solid evidence that self-driving cars are qualitatively safer. 

In my opinion, I don't think it is the time to bring them out and try to adopt them into society. We need time to develop our technology in general to a point where if we were to start using them, they'd have a smooth transition into the market and outside parties would suffer as little as possible. I think they have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society but not right now. 

If we were to start using them in today's society, it wouldn't work out in many ways. Only a small percentage of the population would be able to afford them as they cost more than $100,000 and require training to operate in a safe manner. Furthermore, self-driving cars rely on being adopted by everybody and this will certainly not happen if only the richest people are able to buy them. Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road. This would be detrimental for the lives of many people and also harm the economy. Because of these reasons, 1) I don' think it is feasible to get the general public to use self-driving cars and 2) in the unlikely case that everyone uses them, it would cause damage to the economy.","

The integration of self-driving cars into everyday life in America poses significant feasibility concerns. While their potential benefits are substantial, including enhanced safety through reduced accidents, immunity to distractions, optimized traffic flow, cost savings, and time efficiency, the drawbacks are equally alarming. These include dependence on favorable weather conditions, limitations in detecting human traffic signals, potential malfunctions, reliance on unmastered technologies, and adverse impacts on transportation-related jobs.

In my opinion, the current technological landscape is not yet conducive to a seamless transition of self-driving cars into the market. Widespread adoption would likely exacerbate existing societal and economic challenges. 

Several obstacles hinder the successful integration of self-driving cars into contemporary society. Firstly, their high cost (exceeding $100,000) and requisite training for safe operation render them inaccessible to all but a small, affluent segment of the population. This limited adoption would undermine the technology's full potential, as its effectiveness relies on widespread use. 

Furthermore, the reliance of self-driving cars on interconnected technologies heightens security risks, making them an attractive target for hackers. The potential for specialized computers to harvest personal data also raises significant privacy concerns. 

Even if affordability were not an issue, the broad adoption of self-driving cars would have far-reaching, detrimental consequences. The transportation sector would experience substantial job losses, the gasoline industry would likely decline if self-driving cars are predominantly electric, driver's education courses would become obsolete, and personal injury lawyers would face reduced earnings due to decreased accident rates. These outcomes would profoundly impact the livelihoods of many individuals and have a ripple effect throughout the economy.

Therefore, I contend that: 
1. **Widespread adoption of self-driving cars among the general public is not currently feasible** due to cost, accessibility, and security concerns.
2. **Universal adoption, if achieved, would likely cause significant economic disruption**, highlighting the need for cautious, phased implementation and comprehensive socioeconomic impact assessments. ",draft1_2018argrewrite_39.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"

"After decades of the prosperous advances of artificial intelligence (AI), especially among the last several years when we have benefited from AI tremendously on a variety of domains such as medicine, e-commerce and digit devices, one futuristic industry also equipped with the power of AI is gradually stepping to people's life: the self-driving cars.

We are happy and lucky to be seeing the history of the way that how people are transported changes. The most recent one that is taking place quietly is brought by self-driving cars, which as the name indicates, can drive itself without the operation of human. Sometimes they are called ""driver-less cars"" too. Indeed, the reality is that self-driving cars aren't that far off. Right now, the residents from Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, California and Pennsylvania are fortunate enough to have already seen some tested self-driving cars are running merrily down the streets, wearing lots of cameras which make them look strange but cute.

Alongside the technology of self-driving cars that has emerged during this time while not yet realized, the debate on the pros vs. cons of self-driving cars has already started to rage on. Whether it is a gift of God, or just another devil coming out from Pandora's Box? People hold different ideas. But are self-driving cars really that controversial? If they are, then why hundreds of huge companies, including Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, Tencent, are now researching dramatically on self-driving cars? Are they crazy? Are they wasting their money on these ""terrible"" products? 

The answers can't be too obvious. Self-driving ARE the most beautiful gifts endowed by our God.

There are uncountable benefits of self-driving cars. Among them there are two prominent ones. The first regards the driving safety. While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: ""They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers."" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, which uses delicately designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically. 

The second advantage is that self-driving cars can benefit not only many normal people, but those who desperately need help as well. For example they will give more freedom and enhanced mobility to people who are not suited to driving, such as the handicapped, the drunk or the senior citizens. With self-driving cars, their rely on public transportation or
assistance from others to get around would become minimal.

Well, up till now those people who are pessimistic about self-driving cars may barely argue the their benefits, but they are overly concerning with some potential factors. Here we would list out two of the most controversial issues which, however, are not problems at all, in our opinion. 

Firstly of all, some individuals are concerned about the opportunity for a computer built into the self-driving car to collect personal data. Indeed, we have that risk. However, in the future with the development computers and AI, every device or item in our life will get electronic-wised and the information of every thing's information, a human or physical item, will flow through the internet of things (IOT), in order to make our life more intelligent. Self-driving cars is only a small portion of it the the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.

Second, people argue ""self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers."" This could have a negative impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. However, this effect is short-term, for the sake of long term advancement of human history. In other words, if we forbid the development of self-driving cars because of this short-term interest, then people will improve on transportation in a long term.

Therefore, just let us embrace the bright future of self-driving cars and look forward to enjoying the convenience shortly!","

After decades of remarkable advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which have transformed various domains like medicine, e-commerce, and digital devices, another futuristic industry empowered by AI is poised to revolutionize daily life: self-driving cars.

We are witnessing a pivotal moment in the evolution of transportation. The latest innovation, self-driving cars, which operate without human intervention, is gradually becoming a reality. Sometimes referred to as ""driver-less cars,"" they are no longer a distant concept. Residents in Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, California, and Pennsylvania have already seen test models equipped with multiple cameras navigating streets.

As self-driving car technology emerges, so does the debate over its pros and cons. Are they a blessing or a curse? The diverse opinions notwithstanding, the significant investment by giants like Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, and Tencent in self-driving car research suggests there's more to them than meets the eye.

The benefits of self-driving cars are numerous, with two standing out prominently. Firstly, they significantly enhance driving safety. Human error, often the primary cause of accidents, is mitigated as computers utilize precise algorithms to determine stopping distances and vehicle spacing, drastically reducing accident likelihood. According to Chris Urmson, Google's self-driving car program director, these vehicles are ""more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers.""

Secondly, self-driving cars offer unparalleled freedom and mobility to individuals who need it most, including the handicapped, intoxicated individuals, and senior citizens. Their reliance on public transportation or assistance would diminish substantially.

Despite these advantages, skeptics raise concerns about potential drawbacks. Two of the most contentious issues, however, are, in our view, overstated.

Firstly, the concern over personal data collection by self-driving car computers is valid but not unique to this technology. As the Internet of Things (IoT) integrates more aspects of life, enhancing data protection measures will be crucial, mitigating this risk.

Secondly, the argument that self-driving cars will eliminate transportation sector jobs, particularly in freight and taxi services, is short-sighted. While there may be short-term unemployment impacts, the long-term advancement of human progress justifies these changes.

"The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets since the public sphere became aware of the role these futuristic vehicles could play in the not-to-distant future. First, there are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advanced machinery could have on modern life. These potential issues include the sheer cost of the software, the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car, as well as the security risks of the software itself. The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits. For instance, in California, people purchasing new electric vehicles can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500 depending on the size of the car's battery, and we could see a similar incentive allotted to self-driving cars in the future as their software has the potential to greatly decrease car insurance costs. Other skeptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where traffic signals have failed and police move to the intersection to direct traffic. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch that would allow a driver to take control of the wheel for a period of time so the driver may avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. The potential for the software to be targeted by hackers is another real issue that could become a major problem if the software isn't adequately protected. However, as long as information identifying the owner of each vehicle is kept separate from the car's computer software and the software that controls the cars is linked to a kill switch that could safely pull the car off the road and alert the driver, any substantial damage associated with this threat could be minimized even though the potential to completely protect from it is limited. There are, however, many advantages that I believe outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation within the car, or events happening outside, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be less responsible for people to purchase car insurance and manufacturers who are making vast amounts of money from car sales could cover the cost of the insurance, which would provide consumers with more money to use in the market. Lastly, the potential of platooning and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to due to their inability to operate a vehicle. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives, as long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution.","The Integration of Self-Driving Cars: Weighing the Advantages and Mitigating the Disadvantages

The advent of self-driving cars has sparked intense debate across mainstream media, highlighting both the potential benefits and drawbacks of this technology in the near future. Despite the concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages, provided they are developed with long-term solutions in mind.

**Addressing Perceived Disadvantages:**

1. **Software Costs:** The high cost of software could be offset by federal tax credits, similar to those offered for electric vehicles. For instance, a tax credit up to $7,500, scaled according to the vehicle's technological complexity, could incentivize adoption.
2. **Technological Failures in Unforeseen Circumstances:** Implementing a manual override switch would allow drivers to temporarily take control in situations like failed traffic signals, ensuring safety while maintaining the core accident prevention software.
3. **Security Risks from Hacking:** Separating owner identification from the car's computer software and integrating a kill switch to safely pull the car off the road in case of a hack, would minimize potential damage, though acknowledging that complete protection is challenging.

**Outweighing Advantages:**

1. **Dramatic Reduction in Crashes:** With approximately 80% of accidents attributed to human error—largely due to distraction or impairment—self-driving cars would significantly decrease accident rates, as influenced drivers would not control the vehicle.
2. **Decrease in Car Insurance Costs:** Safer roads and fewer accidents could lead to lower insurance premiums. Manufacturers might even cover these costs, given the reduced risks, freeing up consumer funds for other market expenditures.

",draft1_2018argrewrite_62.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"The Integration of Self-Driving Cars: Weighing the Advantages and Mitigating the Disadvantages

The advent of self-driving cars has sparked intense debate across mainstream media, highlighting both the potential benefits and drawbacks of this technology in the near future. Despite the concerns, I firmly believe that the advantages of self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages, provided they are developed with long-term solutions in mind.

**Addressing Perceived Disadvantages:**

1. **Software Costs:** The high cost of software could be offset by federal tax credits, similar to those offered for electric vehicles. For instance, a tax credit up to $7,500, scaled according to the vehicle's technological complexity, could incentivize adoption.
2. **Technological Failures in Unforeseen Circumstances:** Implementing a manual override switch would allow drivers to temporarily take control in situations like failed traffic signals, ensuring safety while maintaining the core accident prevention software.
3. **Security Risks from Hacking:** Separating owner identification from the car's computer software and integrating a kill switch to safely pull the car off the road in case of a hack, would minimize potential damage, though acknowledging that complete protection is challenging.

**Outweighing Advantages:**

1. **Dramatic Reduction in Crashes:** With approximately 80% of accidents attributed to human error—largely due to distraction or impairment—self-driving cars would significantly decrease accident rates, as influenced drivers would not control the vehicle.
2. **Decrease in Car Insurance Costs:** Safer roads and fewer accidents could lead to lower insurance premiums. Manufacturers might even cover these costs, given the reduced risks, freeing up consumer funds for other market expenditures.
3. **Eradication of Rush Hour Traffic and Enhanced Mobility:** 
   - **Traffic Reduction:** Platooning and inter-vehicle communication could virtually eliminate traffic buildups, slashing commute times.
   - **Enhanced Mobility for All:** Self-driving cars would provide the elderly and those with limited mobility an unparalleled level of independence, enabling them to engage in previously inaccessible activities within their communities.

**Conclusion:**
Embracing self-driving cars, with a focus on long-term development, could revolutionize daily life by significantly enhancing road safety, reducing costs, increasing personal time, and boosting overall societal well-being. By thoughtfully addressing the potential drawbacks, we can harness the full transformative power of this technology. ","The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets since the public sphere became aware of the role these futuristic vehicles could play in the not-to-distant future. First, there are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advanced machinery could have on modern life. These potential issues include the sheer cost of the software, the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car, as well as the security risks of the software itself. The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits. For instance, in California, people purchasing new electric vehicles can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500 depending on the size of the car's battery, and we could see a similar incentive allotted to self-driving cars in the future as their software has the potential to greatly decrease car insurance costs. Other skeptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where traffic signals have failed and police move to the intersection to direct traffic. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch that would allow a driver to take control of the wheel for a period of time so the driver may avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. The potential for the software to be targeted by hackers is another real issue that could become a major problem if the software isn't adequately protected. However, as long as information identifying the owner of each vehicle is kept separate from the car's computer software and the software that controls the cars is linked to a kill switch that could safely pull the car off the road and alert the driver, any substantial damage associated with this threat could be minimized even though the potential to completely protect from it is limited. There are, however, many advantages that I believe outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation within the car, or events happening outside, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be less responsible for people to purchase car insurance and manufacturers who are making vast amounts of money from car sales could cover the cost of the insurance, which would provide consumers with more money to use in the market. Lastly, the potential of platooning and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to due to their inability to operate a vehicle. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives, as long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution."
"Self-driving cars, though only recently becoming a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development and have thoroughly captured the public eye. The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that though it is not perfect, the prospect of driver-less roads would mark a definitive improvement over our current conditions. 

To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. Although it is not yet certain that self-driving cars in their current condition would cause that number to go down, the lack of human fallibility makes the prospect seem likely. Furthermore, whereas human driver tend to fall into a lull of false confidence when they have engaged in a task for an extended period of time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. There is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. 

Furthermore, self-driving cars could give society a method of transportation which is much less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are limited to those capable of operating the machinery, passing their test, and -for the most part - affording to own their own vehicle. If a child needs to be transported to any sort of extracurricular event they are bound by their parents' schedules and mobilities. If a senior citizen who has been deemed unsafe to drive decides to go shopping they must wait for long periods to use public transportation with conditions that could be extremely painful or uncomfortable with those who experience chronic pain from arthritis or similar conditions. Furthermore, many who cannot afford their own car are forced to commute long distances to their jobs, health-care, and programs, forcing a de facto restriction on who may access what. Although it is likely that one who cannot afford a regular car could not afford their own self-driving car, there is nothing to say that they must have their own. The ability to have a car drive back to the place it left from could allow a much more intricate form of car sharing; additionally, the current restrictions on insured drivers that hassle any type of shared vehicle would likely be thoroughly relaxed or missing entirely for a driver-less car. Even beyond the prospect of shared cars, self-driving vehicles could revolutionize public transportation, making a wider range of pick up locations and drop off locations feasible. If large buses or a huge fleet of public cars were to have flexible routes that could give people who do not have the means to own their own car a transportational freedom akin to it at a fraction of the price that services like Uber and Lift offer today. 

A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine much of their success and failure. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it does not seem to be a stretch to claim that this could bring us dramatic improvements.","
Self-driving cars, despite their relatively recent emergence, have rapidly advanced and garnered significant public attention. The debate surrounding their integration into our automotive landscape and societal desirability is ongoing, with passionate arguments on both sides. This essay aims to present compelling evidence that, although imperfect, the prospect of driver-less roads would constitute a marked improvement over our current state.

**Human Fallibility and Enhanced Safety**
Human drivers frequently operate vehicles under suboptimal conditions, such as insufficient sleep, inattention to blind spots, and distraction by mobile devices. With approximately 33,000 annual fatal accidents in the US, and overwhelming evidence attributing a significant portion to human error, it is evident that improvement is necessary. While it is uncertain whether current self-driving cars would immediately reduce this number, their inherent lack of human fallibility makes a decrease likely. Unlike human drivers, who may become complacent over time, self-driving cars can be designed to improve safety through continuous learning and updates. They are impervious to distractions, sleep deprivation, intoxication, and time pressures, ensuring unwavering focus on safe transportation.

**Enhanced Mobility and Societal Inclusivity**
Self-driving cars could revolutionize transportation, making it significantly less restrictive. Currently, driving privileges are contingent upon operational capability, licensure, and vehicle ownership. This limits the mobility of children, senior citizens, and those with chronic conditions, forcing them to rely on others or endure uncomfortable public transportation. The shared mobility potential of self-driving cars—facilitated by their ability to return to a starting point without a driver—could provide a more intricate and accessible car-sharing system, unencumbered by traditional insurance restrictions. Moreover, integrating self-driving vehicles into public transportation could make a broader range of pickup and drop-off locations feasible, offering transportational freedom to those without means, at a fraction of the cost of current ride-sharing services.

**Implementation and Future Society**
A society embracing self-driving cars would undoubtedly be transformed. The success or failure of this shift hinges on implementation strategies. While challenges are anticipated, considering the myriad limitations of our current system, it is reasonable to assert that this transition could yield profound improvements.

"The overall advantages of self-driving cars, when implemented without any setbacks, are that they can be safer, cheaper, and more time saving when compared to the standard way of humans manual driving cars. Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. Self-driving cars would also be cheaper for the government by saving money that would have been spent on transit projects such as building trains. Lastly, self-driving cars would be time saving for both passengers and police officers. Passengers who would now be allowed to rest or perform work on their commute to their destination, and police officers would be able to spend less time catching speeding vehicles on the highway and more time solving more serious crimes. 

Some disadvantages of self-driving cars are cost for creating these vehicles and complex technology/ security required to prevent serious malfunctions and hacks. For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class and rich would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. In addition, like with any technology created this 21st century there are risks for serious and even fatal malfunctions. Although not common, everyday electronics such as iPhones and laptops, concepts deemed impossible a century ago, do in fact experience problems and have stopped working for its users. While iPhones and laptops are nowhere as complex as self-driving cars, the fact of the matter is the electronic advancements made these past decades have been remarkable, but if these items have showed us anything it is that nothing is ever perfect and some software or hardware problem could always occur at any moment and without notice. It would be difficult to program self-driving cars to distinguish between new traffic laws or recent road work that occurred overnight. Also, it would be dangerous if hackers would be able to hijack vehicles and purposely take control of these self-driving vehicles. 

Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives. A human life is the only thing on earth that can't be bought no matter how much money an individual has. Death does not discriminate based on age, gender, sex, religion, race, or social status. Car accidents do occur and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident.","

"Technological advances have made our society more convenient and efficient in a variety of areas, including social networking services, shopping experiences, and personalized online streaming services, although there has always been controversy on whether the technology is making our society better or worse. As we have imagined since decades ago, technologies are now being tested for cars for the purpose of creating safer self-driving cars with the use of sophisticated algorithms. However, as relying on the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect ""errors"" easily which can improve the technology continuously.

First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and commute, which can be particularly hard where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are usually in hurry.
Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we cannot predict that these risks are higher than risks associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. As there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology or not, it would be reasonable to introduce self-driving cars and create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.

Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact, fine-grained cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. Although educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, such changes require time to show the effect. 

In conclusion, I believe that introducing self-driving cars can provide new opportunities for those having difficulty driving and using other transportations and risks associated with the self-driving technologies can be minimized as we collect data, which can decrease the number of car accidents and therefore offer a better experience for people.","
Technological advancements have transformed various aspects of our society, from social networking and e-commerce to personalized streaming services, sparking debates about their overall impact. One such innovation, self-driving cars, leverages sophisticated algorithms to enhance road safety. Despite concerns that relying on this technology could increase accident risks, I firmly believe that self-driving cars can open up opportunities for individuals with diverse challenges and facilitate continuous improvement through error detection.

**Enhancing Mobility for All**
Self-driving cars can revolutionize transportation not just for the general public, but also for people with disabilities, pregnant women, and those who face driving difficulties. Currently, these individuals often rely on underdeveloped public transport systems or assistance, which can be particularly daunting in areas with limited infrastructure or busy urban centers. Self-driving cars offer a personalized, superior alternative for those who struggle with driving and using public transport.

**Mitigating Risks**
While self-driving cars pose risks, such as operating challenges in varied weather and traffic conditions, it's unreasonable to assume these risks surpass those associated with human drivers, like distraction, intoxication, and fatigue. Given that driving inherently carries risks, introducing self-driving cars seems justified, especially to enhance transportation for those who face difficulties.

**Data-Driven Improvement**
A key advantage of self-driving cars is the ability to analyze accident data, pinpoint causes, and refine the algorithm to prevent similar incidents in the future. In contrast, human error accidents often have obscure, fine-grained causes that are difficult to detect and rectify. Traditional preventive measures, such as educational programs and policy changes, require considerable time to yield results.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, introducing self-driving cars can provide unprecedented mobility opportunities for individuals with driving challenges and, through data collection, minimize risks, potentially reducing accidents and offering a superior transportation experience for all.

In conclusion, introducing self-driving cars can provide unprecedented mobility opportunities for individuals with driving challenges and, through data collection, minimize risks, potentially reducing accidents and offering a superior transportation experience for all. ","Technological advances have made our society more convenient and efficient in a variety of areas, including social networking services, shopping experiences, and personalized online streaming services, although there has always been controversy on whether the technology is making our society better or worse. As we have imagined since decades ago, technologies are now being tested for cars for the purpose of creating safer self-driving cars with the use of sophisticated algorithms. However, as relying on the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect ""errors"" easily which can improve the technology continuously.

First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and commute, which can be particularly hard where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are usually in hurry.
Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we cannot predict that these risks are higher than risks associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. As there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology or not, it would be reasonable to introduce self-driving cars and create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.

Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact, fine-grained cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. Although educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, such changes require time to show the effect. 

In conclusion, I believe that introducing self-driving cars can provide new opportunities for those having difficulty driving and using other transportations and risks associated with the self-driving technologies can be minimized as we collect data, which can decrease the number of car accidents and therefore offer a better experience for people."
"It seems that cars have always been the same: four wheels, a body, a steering wheel. They are ridiculously simple! Compare to the history of bicycles for example. If you happen to have seen those old black and white photographs of early bicycles, you will see a complex evolution, akin to those in biology! Nevertheless, something on the horizon is going to turn everything about cars upside down (well, the cars themselves will probably still remain on their four wheels, though!)

Self-driving cars are already among us fueling the debate over their good and and evil. Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the catastrophic number of fatal car crashes because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc. 

However, the opponents of the technology have some legitimate concerns. In this category there are some superficial and trivial arguments that can be refuted right away. For example, the phobia of a scenario where a car breaks down and the human driver, having forgotten how to drive, has no idea of what to do, leading to chaos in the city cannot be a real argument against self-driving cars. Already today, an average individual has no skill to get a car to start up if it all of a sudden stops in the middle of street. Such a situation rarely disrupts a whole city! Some other arguments question the limits of the technology. What if it snows? What if the road is full of potholes (such as those in Pittsburgh!)? Well, these while valid concerns do not prove the technology insufficient. There are improvements coming every day and all those conditions will be taken care of.

With the obvious criticism of the self-driving cars out of way, we arrive at some deep issues against the technology. On the infrastructure level, there is the problem of providing cyber security to such a delicate network of interconnected software that store and communicate data between cars. If, as Guardian suggests, there is a potential for hackers to manipulate such a system, then it will be a true disaster. Achieving a high level of security while possible could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline.

However, the biggest challenge facing self-driving cars is their popularity. The pros listed above all are predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Have you noticed that sometimes, ironically, the safest drivers, are the very cause of some accidents? Imagine a road where the speed limit is 50, but ""everyone knows that it is ok to go 60 (when the police is not around!)"". Then that one guy who sticks to that 50 mph limit is the source of frustration for those behind him/her and a possible danger for everyone involved. Thus, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.

But with the currently high cost of these cars, and the natural public resistance to change, it seems that self-driving cars will, for the coming years, live in the margins, only triggering imagination and debates from time to time. At this point in time, we are just not ready yet to embrace them -- definitely not in large numbers.","

It's striking how the fundamental design of cars has remained relatively unchanged – four wheels, a body, and a steering wheel – unlike the transformative evolution seen in bicycles over the years. However, a revolutionary disruptor is on the horizon: self-driving cars, which are already sparking intense debate about their merits and drawbacks.

Proponents of automated vehicles argue convincingly that they will drastically reduce the alarming rate of fatal car crashes, as machines are immune to distractions, intoxication, and other human frailties. Additional benefits cited include the potential for coordinated speed management and traffic light synchronization among multiple cars, leading to enhanced flow and reduced travel times. With their precision, self-driving cars could also increase road capacity while decreasing congestion. Moreover, they would provide invaluable mobility for the disabled and elderly. As their adoption grows, society could reap numerous rewards: saved lives, avoided financial losses, decreased fuel consumption, and a reduced need for traffic police.

Detractors, however, raise several legitimate concerns. While some superficial worries (e.g., a car breakdown leading to citywide chaos due to forgotten driving skills) are easily refutable – given that most individuals already lack the skills to handle a stranded vehicle – others question the technology's limitations. Concerns about performance in snowy or potholed conditions, though valid, are not insurmountable, as the technology is rapidly advancing to address such challenges.

Beyond these surface-level criticisms lie more profound issues. A significant infrastructure challenge is ensuring the cybersecurity of the complex, interconnected software network facilitating car-to-car communication. As highlighted by The Guardian, the potential for hackers to exploit this system is a daunting risk, potentially offsetting any fuel-efficient savings with exorbitant security costs.

The most substantial hurdle, however, is the widespread adoption of self-driving cars. The envisioned benefits – coordinated traffic flow, enhanced safety – are contingent upon their ubiquity. With current costs being prohibitively high and natural public resistance to change, it appears that self-driving cars will, for the foreseeable future, remain on the periphery, sparking imagination and debate but failing to achieve widespread acceptance. Currently, society seems unprepared to embrace them en masse.@

"There are many advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars but the most important advantage I find is that for self-driving cars it is safer to consistently drive closer together because it is the continuously aware sensor on the car and not the human, who can become easily distracted, that determines how close the car can be to another car. This thereby reduces traffic while still increasing the number of cars that can be on the road. The most important disadvantage I find is that for self driving cars, the electric nature of the self-driving cars may reduce the net profit of gasoline industries. This is to say, that in becoming ""new and improved"" manufacturers may stray away from using gas as fuel and move towards using electricity as fuel because this type of fuel is more environmentally friendly.

It is the exact theme of being environmentally friendly by being efficient that makes me argue that self-driving cars are beneficial to society. I wish to argue that materials that make the air healthier, make the environment healthier, and then make the people who live in the environment healthier. The example allowing more cars to be on the road would make the air healthier especially if the cars were electric because the reference paper argues that this would reduce traffic and so the cars would be on the road for less time. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that less waste emitted from the energy used. This renders the air healthier and the people in this environment healthier. 
Finally, I wish to argue that the electric nature of the cars would make the environment healthier because gasoline powered cars make the environment less clean. In my experiences abroad I often saw trucks emitting black gas clouds to the point that the vision of the driver behind was impaired. When I visit the gas station, the smell of gasoline is never ignored. I do not mind the smell, but I know it is not healthy to inhale for a long time. Also, the threat of gasoline ignition is not one to ignore. I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while trying to refuel my vehicle and if there was a fire nearby this could have become more than a ""small, careless""  mistake. All in all when changes can be made for prevention of dangerous incidents and development of diseases, then these changes move society to a healthier life style. 

For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several advantages to start to develop onto society.","

There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to self-driving cars, but the most significant advantage, in my opinion, is the enhanced safety of reduced following distances. This is achieved through continuously aware sensors, which are less prone to distractions than human drivers. Consequently, this leads to decreased traffic congestion while allowing a greater number of vehicles on the road.

On the other hand, a notable disadvantage is the potential economic impact on the gasoline industry, as manufacturers may shift towards more environmentally friendly electric fuel sources.

However, it is this emphasis on environmental sustainability that underscores the benefits of self-driving cars to society. I argue that the use of eco-friendly materials and efficient technologies has a positive ripple effect: cleaner air, a healthier environment, and ultimately, a healthier population. For instance, reducing traffic congestion with electric self-driving cars decreases the time spent on the road, which in turn minimizes waste emissions and purifies the air, contributing to a healthier environment for its inhabitants.

Furthermore, the transition to electric cars would significantly improve environmental health by mitigating the negative impacts of gasoline-powered vehicles. From personal experience, I've witnessed the hazardous effects of gas emissions from trucks and the unpleasant, unhealthy fumes at gas stations. Moreover, the risk of gasoline ignition is a serious concern, as evidenced by my own close calls with accidental spills. When preventative measures can be taken to avert dangers and diseases, society moves closer to a healthier lifestyle.

In conclusion, considering the potential for a cleaner environment and its far-reaching benefits, I firmly believe that self-driving cars will usher in numerous advantages for society, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and healthier world.

"The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars"", provides an in depth look into the reasoning of whether or not we, as a society, should adopt self-driving vehicles.  Of the 20 ""pros"" listed, an increase in safety was likely the leading factor, but also included were the benefits in commute times and city travel, the possibility for the driver to do something productive in the time that would otherwise be used for driving, and the idea that elderly or disabled people would be able to ride self-driving cars without worry.  However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry. 

When weighing the ""pros"" and ""cons"" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The ""pros"" are all valid, while it appears that many of the ""cons"" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the ""cons"" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles.

Although several more examples supporting the idea that many of the present ""cons"" seen in self-driving vehicle adoption can be corrected in the future, it is unnecessary seeing that they are quite similar.  However, what is important to notice is that all of the ""pros"" do not seem as if they will be changing, even as the vehicles themselves improve.  Therefore I recommend the gradual adoption of self-driving vehicles into society.","

The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars"" offers a comprehensive analysis of the merits of adopting self-driving vehicles.

In contrast, the article also outlines 20 drawbacks, focusing on operational training, high upfront costs, security concerns (personal and cybersecurity), legal implications, technical limitations, and the potential disruption of the automotive industry.

When evaluating the trade-offs, it's essential to consider the broader context. The listed ""pros"" are universally valid, whereas many ""cons"" can be mitigated as the technology advances. For instance, the initial high cost can be offset by the historical trend of new technologies experiencing significant price drops over time, as exemplified by the rapid decrease in computer prices over the decades.

"The forward march of technology has always been a source of controversy for society. Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slates with pencil and paper in schoolhouses was a shift that created public dialogue. It is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, highlighting our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but the application of it in our day to day lives presents many important questions that first need answering.
     Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will be able to have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because computers have one thing to focus on. They don't worried about the kids, their date, or their finances like humans do, nor can they get drunk or distracted. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more, which would all add together into a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might cease to exist! Insurance and healthcare costs would decrease with less accidents as well, and these companies might even be forced to establish a new business model. 
     However, there is always more than one side to an argument. There are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. ""Trolley problems"", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology that can be hacked and have some of their functions remotely controlled. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Rainstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem is that system can't see roads. 
     There are so many angles on this problem that its probably a good thing we are still a ways off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but I also see the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of someone else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave of pushing our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for a collective change that takes away our own individual cars and replaces them with devices that have no character. I say wait a decade and see where the technology has gone.","

The relentless advancement of technology has consistently sparked societal debate. From the humble replacement of chalk and slates with pencils and paper in schools to the impending integration of self-driving cars, each innovation prompts crucial discussions. As we stand at the cusp of autonomous vehicles transforming our daily lives, it's essential to scrutinize the pros and cons.

Self-driving cars, once a staple of science fiction, have evolved from a far-fetched idea just seven years ago to a tangible reality. Now, as we witness their functionality firsthand, we must delve into the benefits and drawbacks. A key advantage lies in enhanced safety. Ideally designed autonomous vehicles can surpass human driving safety standards due to their singular focus, unencumbered by human distractions, intoxication, or diversion. Additionally, self-driving cars can optimize traffic patterns through coordinated vehicle communication, maintaining safe distances and sharing road condition updates, potentially eradicating rush hour congestion. This, in turn, could lead to decreased insurance and healthcare costs, forcing a paradigm shift in these industries.

Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slates with pencil and paper in schoolhouses was a shift that created public dialogue. It is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, highlighting our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but the application of it in our day to day lives presents many important questions that first need answering.
     Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will be able to have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because computers have one thing to focus on. They don't worried about the kids, their date, or their finances like humans do, nor can they get drunk or distracted. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more, which would all add together into a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might cease to exist! Insurance and healthcare costs would decrease with less accidents as well, and these companies might even be forced to establish a new business model. 
     However, there is always more than one side to an argument. There are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. ""Trolley problems"", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology that can be hacked and have some of their functions remotely controlled. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Rainstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem is that system can't see roads. 
     There are so many angles on this problem that its probably a good thing we are still a ways off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but I also see the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of someone else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave of pushing our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for a collective change that takes away our own individual cars and replaces them with devices that have no character. I say wait a decade and see where the technology has gone."
"Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a successful future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as police/first responders can deal with other emergencies instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation, mostly due to price, and the many troubles and hassles that will arise after implementation.
            After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that the problems outweigh the benefits. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to afford them.
           Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime.
            The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions.
            To conclude, self-driving cars are not a benefit to society. This because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking.","

Self-driving cars are expected to hit the market within the next several years, sparking intense debate about their potential impact. Proponents argue that these vehicles will revolutionize transportation by reducing accidents (attributable to human error in 81% of cases), enhancing mobility for the disabled, and optimizing emergency response times. Conversely, opponents cite concerns over implementation costs and post-launch challenges. After weighing the benefits and drawbacks, I firmly believe that the latter outweigh the former.

A primary concern is the exorbitant cost of self-driving cars, projected to average $100,000 upon commercial release. The expensive machinery required to manufacture these vehicles will render them inaccessible to the majority of Americans, thereby limiting their societal benefit to the affluent few.

Furthermore, the introduction of self-driving cars will have a ripple effect, disrupting various transportation sectors, including trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technological shift will inevitably lead to widespread job losses among human operators, potentially exacerbating unemployment, economic instability, and even crime rates as affected individuals struggle to find new employment opportunities.

Moreover, the vulnerability of self-driving cars to hacking poses a significant threat, undermining their primary advantage: enhanced safety. The risk of malicious hacking, which could lead to catastrophic consequences, such as deliberate crashes or vehicles being driven off-course, cannot be overstated.

In conclusion, self-driving cars are not a net positive for society due to their prohibitively high cost, devastating impact on employment and the economy, and susceptibility to hacking, which compromises their core safety benefit. Ultimately, these substantial drawbacks outweigh the potential advantages, necessitating a more cautious approach to their development and implementation.",draft1_2018argrewrite_59.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years.

"It seems that we are moving rapidly forward to a future that will consist of a majority of self-driving cars. Along with all major technological advancements that have occurred in the twenty-first century there are major pros and major cons to this advancement.
 In general, many of the pros center preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.
There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. additionally, many people rely on providing transportation as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may effect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident?
With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out the human errors are extremely important. With more and more cars being on the roads today, there is a higher and higher chance to be in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, I feel, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back.To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful. Overall, I believe that these benefits greatly outweigh the costs.","

As we accelerate towards a future dominated by self-driving cars, it's essential to weigh the significant advantages and disadvantages of this technological leap. 

**Preventive Benefits:**
