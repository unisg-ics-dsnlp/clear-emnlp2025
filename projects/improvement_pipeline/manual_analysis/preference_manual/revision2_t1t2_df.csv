While risks accompany the adoption of self-driving car technology, the benefits substantially outweigh them, compelling us to advocate for its integration into our society.

**Enhancing Efficiency and Safety**
Have you ever been frustrated by unnecessary traffic congestion, pondering the time and fuel wasted? Have concerns about public safety, due to distracted, impaired, or reckless drivers, ever crossed your mind? Self-driving cars offer a multifaceted solution: enhancing roadway efficiency, liberating time and resources, and mitigating human error to bolster safety.

**Elevating the Riding Experience**
With self-driving cars dominating the roads, your commute would become significantly more enjoyable. As noted by Eno Transportation, synchronized self-driving vehicles can optimize traffic flow, preemptively identify potential road hazards, and streamline each passenger's journey. The coordination among these vehicles ensures efficiency and comfort.

**Addressing Security Concerns**
While the sophisticated software might raise concerns about hacking vulnerabilities, it's essential to acknowledge the rapid development of hacking prevention methods, paralleling advancements in personal tech security. This proactive approach safeguards against potential threats.

**Maximizing Time and Resources**
Self-driving cars not only reduce commute times but also optimize gasoline usage, yielding more leisure time for drivers and passengers alike. This freedom enables individuals to utilize their time in the vehicle for activities like reading or socializing, as highlighted in a recent Forbes article. Although initial vigilance might still be required, the evolution of the technology will inevitably give rise to truly passive driving experiences. The accompanying reduction in fuel costs presents an additional societal benefit.

**Eliminating Human Error**
At the core of driving challenges lies human fallibility, leading to traffic congestion, accidents, and other mishaps. Self-driving cars leverage advanced algorithms to perfect braking, obstacle avoidance, and inter-vehicle distancing, drastically reducing collisions. By removing human error, these vehicles prevent accidents caused by distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers. Although mechanical failure poses a minor risk, it pales in comparison to the dangers of human driving.

**Embracing Progress**
While caution is advised when integrating new technologies, self-driving cars promise to enhance our driving experiences, grant us more time, and ensure our safety. By embracing this innovation, we pave the way for a more efficient, safer, and more leisurely future. ","What once seemed like a faraway science fiction fantasy is now becoming a reality. Testing of self-driving cars is happening right here and now in our city of Pittsburgh. As technology advances and becomes ever more a part of our daily lives, we must consider the consequences of embracing the shiny and new. Though there are risks associated with adopting self-driving car technology into our society, the benefits of doing so greatly outweigh the risks. Because of this, we should stand for self-driving car technology and its benefits to society.

Have you ever been trapped in an unnecessary traffic slowdown? Have you thought about how much time and gas you could save if the roadways and cars operated more efficiently? Have you ever been concerned about public safety because of dangerous drivers who may be distracted, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or otherwise impaired? All of these problems could be solved with self-driving cars. The widespread use of self-driving cars could improve efficiency of roadways, free up time and resources for members of society, and eliminate the human error of driving, improving roadway safety.

If self-driving cars ruled the roadway, your riding experience would be much more enjoyable. According to Eno Transportation, when self-driving cars communicate and work together on the road, they are able to improve traffic conditions and congestion. They are also able to identify road risks early on to avoid further frustration during your ride. The coordination between self-driving cars would make every passenger's ride more efficient. Some may express concern that with all of this advanced software comes an opportunity for hackers to take over and compromise safety on the road. Though this is a legitimate concern, it should be tempered with the knowledge that methods for hacking prevention are on the rise since this is a concern in all technological aspects of our lives like our personal computers and cell phones.

Self-driving cars also reduce commute times and would maximize gasoline usage. This would create more free time in the lives of drivers and passengers everywhere. Not only would it create time directly through commute reduction, but it would also potentially allow drivers to spend time in the car doing other things like reading or talking with other passengers, as highlighted by a recent article in Forbes. It could be argued that drivers will still need to maintain focus while riding in self-driving cars. This may be true initially, but as the technology improves and becomes more widespread, passive driving will become a reality. Reduced costs associated with gasoline are just an added benefit for society!

When it comes down to it, human error is the source of difficulties with driving. Traffic, congestion, and car accidents are all a result of humans being imperfect drivers. Self-driving cars use advanced algorithms and technology to know when to brake, how to avoid obstacles, and how to maintain an optimum distance from surrounding cars, thus decimating the number of fender benders and other accidents between cars that happen on a daily basis. Self-driving cars would take human error out of the picture, preventing distracted, intoxicated, or impaired drivers from causing fatal car accidents. Though there is always the small risk of mechanical failure to result in an accident, this risk is minute compared to the risk of humans being behind the wheel.

Accepting new technology into our society should not be done hastily, but self-driving car technology is one that will improve our lives. With self-driving cars, we will have better driving experiences, we will have more time, and we will be safer."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_2.txt,"Self-driving car is a new technology and receives a lot of debates recently. On one hand, self-driving cars offer positive impacts, e.g. safer commuting, cost savings, and democratize commuting. On the other hand, the technology also raises a number of concerns, e.g. security, safety, and economy.

In my opinion, I support self-driving cars. The technology will have positive impacts on the society. First, self-driving cars are supposed to be more safety because it eliminates mistakes made by a human, such as driving under the influence (of alcohol, drugs, or tiredness). Moreover, drivers tend to have a false confidence over time. This false confidence will increase the chances that an accident will happen. Second, we will save a lot of money with this technology. Because when a lot of self-driving cars are on the street and communicate with each other, they can reduce the problem with congestion or unknown traffic conditions. Consequently, we can save the cost of gas and our traveling time. Last but not least, self-driving cars democratize commuting and put an equity for people having difficulties in traveling, such as old people or disabilities. While public transportations are available in all cities, they only operate on a pre-designated route and stop at particular locations (e.g. bus stops) rather than the travelers' desired destinations (a coffee shop on a small street) and schedules (after midnight). Furthermore, self-driving cars also provide private space for the travelers while in public transportations the travelers must share the space with many strangers.

The cons about self-driving cars could be categorized into two groups: the not-ready and the not-true groups. The not-ready group contains arguments of new challenges of the technology that our society has not addressed, e.g. legal responsibility and security. For example, when an accident is made by a self-driving car, who will hold the responsibility? What would car-makers or software designers handle moral-sensitive situations? For example, which choice should be made by the self-driving car given an unavoidable accident killing either an old pedestrian crossing the street or a baby in a stroller on the pavement? Security is another critical issue, such as how can drivers protect their personal data or even the self-driving cars if the vehicles are hacked? These issues must be addressed or disclosed before deploying self-driving cars in the mass. On the other hand, the not-true group consists of false assumptions about the self-driving technology, e.g. human drivers' skills, different traffic regulations, interpreting police officers' signals, or human workers. For example, there are concerns about drivers are no longer equipped with the skills to operate cars. In fact, we are living well in a society without knowing much about our daily stuff. I don't know anything about fixing a car, but I can always call AAA or my friends whenever my car breaking down. Another false opinion is the traffic regulation differences between states, e.g. turning right on red or not. In fact, cars can update its algorithm according to the state it is traveling simply based on GPS signal. They said that cars cannot interpret police officers' signals when directing traffics. However, when all cars on the streets are self-driving cars, police officers do not bother going down the streets and directs the traffic. The officers just send information to the cars through a communication channel, e.g. 3G or wifi. Last but not least, some people even afraid that auto manufacturers might sell fewer cars and this will affect human workers. This is not true as a self-driving car is still a car which needs to be manufactured. In fact, we have seen more and more car manufacturers join the self-driving race nowadays, such as Volvo, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and many more.

In conclusion, I think self-driving car is a revolution that will have more benefit to our society. However, there are still some concerns needed to be addressed in order to make this technology available to everyone.","

Self-driving cars have sparked intense debate in recent times. On one hand, they offer numerous benefits, including enhanced safety, cost savings, and increased mobility for all. On the other hand, concerns about security, safety, and economic impact have been raised.

Personally, I advocate for self-driving cars, believing they will positively transform our society. Firstly, by eliminating human errors - such as driving under the influence or due to fatigue - self-driving cars significantly enhance road safety. Additionally, the false confidence that often develops in human drivers, increasing the likelihood of accidents, is mitigated. Secondly, widespread adoption of self-driving cars, which can communicate with each other, will optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and unknown traffic conditions. This, in turn, will save both fuel costs and travel time. Lastly, self-driving cars democratize mobility, providing equitable access for individuals with travel difficulties, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. Unlike public transportation, which is limited by fixed routes and schedules, self-driving cars offer direct, private travel to desired destinations at any time.

Concerns about self-driving cars can be categorized into two main groups: unresolved challenges and misconceptions. The first group includes unaddressed legal and security issues. For instance, questions of liability in the event of an accident, how vehicles will handle morally complex decisions, and the security of personal data against hacking must be resolved before mass deployment. Conversely, the second group comprises misconceptions about the technology. These include fears about the erosion of human driving skills, incompatibility with varying traffic regulations, the inability to interpret police signals, and job losses in the automotive manufacturing sector. However, these concerns are unfounded: individuals can always seek assistance for car troubles, self-driving cars can update their algorithms based on location, police can direct traffic through digital means, and the manufacturing of self-driving cars will actually sustain, if not increase, demand in the automotive industry, as evidenced by the growing number of manufacturers involved, including Volvo, BMW, Toyota, and Honda.

In conclusion, while self-driving cars promise a revolutionary benefit to society, it is crucial that the outstanding concerns are addressed to ensure the technology's universal adoption and success. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_21.txt,"Many car accidents are preventable and an alarming number of them is a result of distracted driving. Self-driving cars might not be the answer.

Equipped with multiple sensors and advanced algorithms, a self-driving car is more likely to be an ideal driver; a self-driving car is more accurate, reliable, and focused than a human driver. However, engineers are still researching the self-driving technology. Many practical questions need be answered. For example, who will  drive the car if the technology fails? This op-ed article will convince you that we should not use self-driving cars.

First, like human, technology could fail. Who will shoulder the responsibility of driving when the technology fails? We know that there is a big circulating head on top of a self-driving car. It is the “eye” and “ear” of the car. When a human driver is  navigating through a storm, they use their senses to make informed decisions. However, in extreme conditions, the “eye” and the “ear” of the car might be damaged. A “blind” driver cannot safely operate a car. In addition, self-driving cars might discourage prospective drivers from attending driver’s education courses. In the case of failed technology, unskilled human operators are not ready to shoulder the responsibility of driving, and there are consequences.

Who should be responsible for the consequences caused by a malfunctioning self-driving car? When a self-driving car malfunctions, the people inside of the car may not be able to gain control quickly. An accident could easily happen during the  time lapsed between a mechanical failure and an attempt to gain control over the car. In a court of law, it is very difficult to determine who is responsible in this case. We do not want accidents: we want reliable technology.

Proponents of self-driving cars argue that self-driving cars reduce the cost of driving and alleviate societal burden. On the contrary, the cost of self-driving cars is much high than expected.The research dollars that companies poured into testings will be paid by the consumers in the long run. In addition, self-driving cars are equipped with sensors that carry a high maintenance and replacement fee. A self-driving car is still a luxury for the general public. The benefits of self-driving cars cannot be reaped if they are not widely used. Additionally, unemployment rates would roar for the transportation industry because machines will replace human labors. The gasoline industry will also suffer immensely since self-driving cars are very likely to be electric.","
Many car accidents are preventable, often caused by distracted driving. While self-driving cars may seem like a solution, this op-ed will argue that their adoption is premature.

Equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms, self-driving cars can outperform humans in accuracy, reliability, and focus. However, significant practical concerns remain unaddressed. For instance, who assumes control when the technology fails? This question is crucial, as the failure of a self-driving car's sensory suite – its ""eye"" and ""ear"" – can occur, especially in extreme weather conditions, rendering the vehicle effectively ""blind"" and unable to operate safely.

The failure of self-driving technology poses several risks. Firstly, the potential discouragement of prospective drivers from attending driving education courses could leave unskilled operators ill-equipped to take over in the event of a malfunction, leading to severe consequences. Secondly, assigning responsibility for accidents caused by a malfunctioning self-driving car is a complex legal issue, given the time lapse between failure and attempted human intervention.

Proponents argue that self-driving cars reduce driving costs and alleviate societal burdens. However, several counterpoints emerge:
1. **Economic Infeasibility**: The high development costs will be passed on to consumers, and the maintenance and replacement of sensors will incur substantial fees, making self-driving cars a luxury for the masses.
2. **Limited Benefits**: Widespread adoption is necessary to reap the benefits, which is unlikely given the current economic constraints.
3. **Socioeconomic Impacts**: The transportation industry will face significant unemployment as machines replace human labor, and the gasoline industry will suffer greatly with the anticipated shift to electric self-driving cars.

In conclusion, while self-driving cars show promise, the unresolved issues of technological failure, economic viability, and socioeconomic impacts necessitate a cautious approach, suggesting that we should not yet rely on self-driving cars. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_74.txt,"

Not having to worry about paying attention while driving may seem appealing, but the risks associated with relying on self-driving cars far outweigh this convenience. 

Several US states, including Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan, and California, are testing self-driving cars equipped with artificial intelligence. However, these trials have revealed that the potential dangers of these vehicles surpass their benefits. While self-driving cars can prevent accidents caused by human error, they introduce new safety hazards and do not completely eliminate the risk of accidents.

Given that car accidents already account for a significant number of deaths in the United States, incorporating the unpredictability of self-driving cars only exacerbates the situation, posing greater risks to all road users.

A significant concern is the vulnerability of self-driving cars to cyber threats. According to the Auto Insurance Center, ""The high-security features of self-driving cars would ironically make them a prime target for hackers."" A compromised self-driving car could be manipulated to follow incorrect routes, collide with obstacles, or redirect passengers to unsafe locations, leading to potential injuries and problems.

Even if the self-driving software were to become hack-proof, technical and user errors could still occur, mirroring the accident risks associated with traditional vehicles.

Furthermore, the implementation of self-driving cars would come with a hefty price tag. The entire existing fleet of human-driven vehicles would need to be replaced, necessitating the scrapping of old cars and the manufacturing of new ones, as well as additional user training. As highlighted by the Auto Insurance Center, ""Drivers would still require knowledge on safe operation, even after the computer takes control.""

While a notable counterargument is that self-driving cars could greatly improve the lives of people with disabilities by providing easily accessible transportation, thereby addressing the limitations of current public transportation systems, this benefit is outweighed by the overarching concerns.

In conclusion, self-driving cars pose more of a hindrance to society than a benefit, introducing widespread danger and exorbitant costs. It would be more prudent to focus on enhancing the safety and efficiency of current human-driven vehicles and developing driver education programs. ","Not having to worry about paying attention while driving is cool, but dying because your computerized, self-driven car made a mistake is not.

Washington, D.C., Nevada, Florida, Michigan and California are testing cars with artificial intelligence, and they're proving that the hassle creates more danger than the convenience is worth. While it's shown that self-driving cars can prevent accidents caused by human drivers, they don't completely eliminate them and in fact, offer their own set of safety hazards.

While car accidents account for a large portion of deaths in the United States, adding the unpredictability of self-driving cars' capabilities for safe driving only make matters more hazardous for everyone on the road.

According to Auto Insurance Center, ""The very security behind self-driving cars would be a major obstacle, especially because the technology would be of very high interest to hackers.""

If a hacker got control of a self-driving car, it could cause problems by inputting incorrect directions, leading a car into an obstacle or causing an accident, as well as by leading people to unsafe locations. The convenience of having an autonomous vehicle seems minor to the possible injuries and problems for individuals.

Even if the software necessary to make automobiles self-driving somehow becomes hack-proof, there are still technical and user errors at play that could cause accidents, just like in regular cars.

In addition to this new technology being dangerous for everyone involved, and even those that aren't, it would also be very expensive to implement. All current human-driven vehicles would need to be replaced, which requires workers to scrap the old cars and build new ones. Additional training would be necessary for users to understand the self-driving cars and what to do in an emergency.

""While the computer takes over once the vehicle is operational, the driver would still be required to maintain some knowledge about how to operate it safely,"" Auto Insurance Center said.

An important counterpoint for the dangers of autonomous vehicles is that they can significantly help the lives of people with disabilities by providing transportation that is easily accessible. Current public transportation methods, while allowing individuals to not have to drive themselves, still exclude those with certain disabilities and are less convenient.

In general, self-driving cars will be more of a hindrance to society than a help. Not only would they present danger to everyone on the road, they would be too expensive to use world- or even country-wide. Time and energy is better spent improving current human-driven cars as well as creating programs to better educate drivers."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_28.txt,"Up with Self-Driving Cars and Down with Gasoline Industry

Self-driving cars are beneficial to society since they will eliminate many accidents and the gasoline industry which causes too much pollution and whose time has run out. The computer running the car won’t be distracted like humans. The average attention span is only eight seconds so a person might not respond fast enough to a deer in the headlights or a bicyclist going past. Human error causes 94% of traffic accidents. Most traffic accidents are caused by drunk and distracted driving.

A self-driving car will prevent many accidents especially ones caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving is a common cause of traffic accidents. Often people like to talk or text on their cell phones, eat and drink, talk to people in their vehicle, or play with the radio/CD player while driving which is highly dangerous. Children, pets, conversations, and preoccupations such as applying makeup can distract a driver.

Other causes of accidents such as speeding, drunk or reckless driving, running red lights, running stop signs, unsafe lane changes, wrong-way driving, road rage, and drowsy driving will be eliminated.

A self-driving car will probably be electric and electric cars will be better for the environment. Electric cars are more efficient and generate less pollution. An electric car is very quiet and very smooth compared to gas operated cars which are clunky and outdated. Electric cars are cheaper to operate so have a big cost advantage over gas. Electric cars are also more efficient so cost about one-third to one-quarter the cost of gasoline. Maintenance costs are less since electric cars don’t need oil changes. Since electric cars don’t have a tailpipe they will improve the air quality.

Gas cars pollute the atmosphere so it’s time we eliminate or lessen the gasoline industry so we can breathe healthier air. High levels of chemicals taken in from gasoline exposure like benzene may cause cancer. The inhalation of fumes can lead to confusion, dizziness, headaches and breathing difficulties. Using gasoline is bad since it relies on fossil fuels which are in short supply and dwindling. Therefore it’s time we switched to electric cars.

The mechanics in gas garages can be trained to work on electric cars instead or for other jobs. When we switched from the horse and buggy to cars we didn’t worry about the people who raised horses losing jobs. We can’t let that stop inevitable progress. People who don’t own cars will still ride the buses and take taxis so those operating the vehicles will still have jobs.

Although self-driving cars are still in our future, it's inevitable that they are bound to replace our existing cars when the price comes down. Hybrid cars are the first step to electric cars which have been around for over a hundred years. Electric cars are finally entering the mainstream thanks to improved battery technology, faster charging, greater range and lower costs. They are available in virtually every size and style, from compact two-seaters to seven-passenger SUVs. Modern electric cars can travel between 100 and 400 miles on a single charge, depending on type and driving conditions, so range anxiety is still a concern for some.","Embracing Self-Driving Cars and a Farewell to the Gasoline Industry

Self-driving cars will revolutionize society by drastically reducing accidents and transforming the transportation landscape, ultimately rendering the polluting gasoline industry obsolete. Unlike humans, self-driving car computers won't succumb to distractions. With the average human attention span being merely eight seconds, drivers often fail to react promptly to unexpected obstacles, such as deer or bicyclists. This human error accounts for a staggering 94% of traffic accidents, frequently caused by distracted, drunk, or reckless driving.

**Enhanced Road Safety**

* Self-driving cars will significantly mitigate accidents, particularly those caused by distracted drivers, who often engage in perilous activities like texting, eating, or grooming while driving.
* Additional causes of accidents, including speeding, drunk driving, running red lights, and drowsy driving, will be effectively eliminated.

**Environmental Benefits and Economic Advantages of Electric Vehicles**

* Self-driving cars will likely be electric, offering numerous environmental benefits, including increased efficiency and drastically reduced pollution.
* Electric vehicles boast a smoother, quieter ride, and their operational costs are substantially lower, approximately one-third to one-quarter of those associated with gasoline-powered cars.
* Maintenance costs decrease, as electric cars do not require oil changes, and the absence of tailpipes improves air quality.

**The Gasoline Industry's Detrimental Impact and Inevitable Decline**

* Gasoline-powered cars pollute the atmosphere, posing serious health risks, including cancer and respiratory issues, due to toxic chemicals like benzene.
* The reliance on dwindling fossil fuels further solidifies the need to transition away from the gasoline industry.
* As we adapt to electric cars, mechanics can undergo training to work on these vehicles or transition into other roles, mirroring the historical shift from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.

**The Inevitable Rise of Self-Driving, Electric Cars**

* Although still in development, self-driving cars will inevitably replace traditional vehicles as prices decrease.
* The evolution from hybrid to electric cars, now available in various sizes and styles, has been facilitated by advancements in battery technology, faster charging, and greater range, with modern electric cars capable of traveling 100 to 400 miles on a single charge. While range anxiety persists, it will continue to diminish as technology improves."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_76.txt,"3. am in the morning after drinking with your best friends at junior high, you are exhausted, lost, and drunk in the middle of nowhere. You want to call a cab, but no one is near. You want to drive home, but you are too scared to start the gear. What you need is a self-driving car.

Autonomous driving is a new and contentious area. There are many uncertainties related to this field. Some people may contend that it is unclear how self-driving cars will manage various hazards on the road. Some people may insist that rely too much on technology will turn people dumb. Some people may argue that starting up a new technique will spend too much money. Despite having so many challenges, researches in self-driving cars are promising in my opinion. I believe that self-driving cars can help people to save their time, reduce the number of traffic accidents, and provide freedom and benefit to the disabled and the elder. 
To me, the most important benefit that self-driving car can bring is that it can save us from wasting too much time driving and parking. While the computer is looking up the map and calculating distances, people in the car can enjoy themselves. Besides, the platooning among self-driving cars can partially solve congestion. This will decrease the amount of time people need to spend on the roads. Furthermore, if the computational algorithm is accurate enough, people no longer need a strict speed limit. People using a self-driving car will be able to drive faster and hence save their time. Additionally, sensors in cars may allow cars to ride closer to each other. With more car on the road, people will have less traffic jam and navigate more efficiently. As you can see, the self-driving car can significantly save our time used in transport.

Another critical aspect is that self-driving car can save our lives. Let us first admit that as one of the most intelligent creatures on earth, we can be very easily distracted. We might be careful at the very beginning, but after a few months of driving, we assume that we are expert drivers and pay much less attention to the road. Our mind flows away when we drive before we notice. Besides, human drivers are not always reliable. There are millions of people driving under the effect of alcohol or drug. And there are more people driving when they are exhausted, sleepy or grumpy. According to the Center for Disease Control, “Many of [traffic] accidents are preventable, and an alarming number of them are a result of distracted driving.” Compared to humans, AI can never be distracted when driving. Neither can it be drunk, sick or tired. It uses a complicated algorithm and communicates with another self-driving car to ensure traffic safety. Thus, it is better to let AI take the wheel.

It is also worthy of notice that self-driving cars can allow the elder and the disabled to drive. Without an AI driver, they have to rely heavily on public transportation or other people in order to travel. However, you cannot expect buses to arrive whenever you want. Friends or family members are not available at 24/7 too. Hence, self-driving cars can be your loyal friends. Therefore, self-driving cars can allow the disabled and elder citizens to drive.

In conclusion, it is safe to say that self-driving cars are our future. By using the self-driving cars, we can save more pedestrians’ lives, save our time and take greater care of the elder and disabled citizens.","

1. **Late-Night Safety Scenario**: Imagine being stranded at 3 am after a night out with friends from junior high - exhausted, lost, and intoxicated. Calling a cab is not an option due to the remote location, and driving yourself is out of the question due to safety concerns. This is where a self-driving car becomes the ideal solution.

**The Promising Future of Autonomous Driving**: Despite the controversies and uncertainties surrounding autonomous vehicles, research in this field shows great promise. While some may argue about the management of road hazards, over-reliance on technology leading to diminished human capabilities, or the high startup costs, the benefits of self-driving cars are compelling.

**Key Advantages of Self-Driving Cars**:

- **Time Efficiency**: Self-driving cars can significantly reduce time wastage associated with driving and parking. With the computer handling navigation, occupants can relax or be productive. The platooning of self-driving cars can mitigate congestion, further decreasing travel time. Moreover, with precise algorithms, speed limits could be less stringent, allowing for faster travel. Advanced sensors enabling closer vehicle proximity will also reduce traffic jams and enhance navigation efficiency.

- **Enhanced Road Safety**: Humans, despite their intelligence, are prone to distractions while driving, especially after initial caution wears off. Factors like driving under the influence, exhaustion, or emotional states further increase accident risks. According to the Center for Disease Control, many accidents are preventable, often resulting from distracted driving. In contrast, AI drivers are never distracted, intoxicated, sick, or tired, utilizing complex algorithms and inter-vehicle communication to ensure safety.

- **Empowerment of the Elderly and Disabled**: Self-driving cars offer the elderly and disabled unparalleled independence. Currently, they must rely on public transport or others for mobility, which is not always convenient or available. Self-driving cars can be their reliable, around-the-clock companions, providing the freedom to travel at will.

**Conclusion**: In conclusion, self-driving cars embody our transportation future. By embracing this technology, we can significantly reduce pedestrian fatalities, conserve time, and provide enhanced care and independence to our elderly and disabled citizens, revolutionizing the way we interact with transportation.

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_8.txt,"The growth of technology and machines has been at its panache in the 21st century. Humans have found a way to automate every possible task using the availability of high computing power and sophisticated algorithms. Driving has been a passion for some and mundane task for others but can be considered an important skill to have. Recent improvements in road infrastructure has reduced the overall effort required in driving. Self-Driving cars can eliminate that mundane task of driving and can specifically help reduce the effort for taxi drivers for who pursue this as a job rather than a passion or a personal choice. However I do not strongly agree with the implementation of self-driving vehicles as that can have certain consequences which are not that necessary.

Most of us millennial's these days start driving at an early age, growing worldwide economy, availability of cheaper cars have helped the gap and luxury to drive a car in recent time. Self-driving cars which can drastically reduce the effort required in driving can be beneficial to some but redundant to others. Born and raised in foothills of the great Himalayas, we never had the luxury of best of the infrastructure. Deadly Himalayan curves required a lot of concentration in driving, and it has been always been a challenge and will remain so to drive in such remote areas. Self-driving cars have been tested and performed exceptionally well in the United States, the country known for its infrastructure and cars which are also a symbol of personal freedom. Developed countries like the United States cannot be the ultimate testing ground for self-driving cars and we should concern tougher testing grounds for proper implementation. Also success of self-driving cars currently relies on accurate mapping systems through GPS and such accuracy is not yet available at every location possible. GPS are not very reliable to weather conditions and that indirectly relates to self-driving cars. Such technology relies heavily on the field known as machine learning and algorithms used to train such cars can still not give 100% accuracy and that can lead to major concerns in unwanted scenarios.

Another major concern involving self-driving cars is that we still need humans who are capable to operate sophisticated technology.  Many individuals are still reluctant to use technology at its best and that is true for many people in their middle and old age.  Such nervousness to operate technology and hesitance to give control to a machine can lead to malfunction and can put the driver into even more dangerous situation.Even if we remove, above concerns, the cost involved in such implementation on large scale is tremendous and somewhat financially not feasible. The cost involved in implementation, the perfect road infrastructure surpass the expected utility of the complete program.

Reduction in overall accidents, for which self-driving cars have been praised has been somewhat skeptical in recent times. We have seen many cases where self-driving cars have been part of accidents and they do not completely eliminate the problem. A simple malfunction in the machine can lead to major issues and it can be somewhat difficult for the human operator to understand this and can lead to major accidents within seconds due to lack of manual control. Himalayan roads where the driver has to showcase full concentration at every curve can turn out to be deadly for self-driving cars in case of any malfunction.

In conclusion, self-driving vehicles can be great research idea but are exact real world implementation is limited due to multiple constraints like civil infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, finances, and costs It is much easier to successfully implement such project in developed nations and in constrained environment but not feasible everywhere around the world.","

The 21st century has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, with automation transforming numerous aspects of life. Driving, a skill once deemed essential, is now on the cusp of revolution with Self-Driving Cars (SDCs). While SDCs can alleviate the monotony of driving, particularly for professional drivers, their implementation raises concerns that outweigh their benefits.

The widespread adoption of driving among millennials, facilitated by improved road infrastructure and affordable vehicles, renders SDCs beneficial to some but redundant to others. Notably, regions with challenging terrains, like the Himalayan foothills, pose significant driving challenges that SDCs may not fully address. The success of SDCs in countries like the United States, known for its robust infrastructure and car culture, may not translate globally. 

Several concerns hinder the universal implementation of SDCs:

1. **Infrastructure and GPS Limitations**: SDCs rely heavily on accurate mapping systems, which are not universally available, particularly in areas with unreliable GPS signals due to weather conditions.
2. **Machine Learning and Algorithmic Fallibility**: Despite advancements in machine learning, SDC algorithms can still fail, leading to potentially catastrophic outcomes in unforeseen scenarios.
3. **Technophobia and Operational Challenges**: Many, especially the middle-aged and elderly, are hesitant to cede control to machines, potentially leading to malfunctions and increased danger.
4. **Exorbitant Implementation Costs**: The financial burden of implementing SDCs on a large scale, including the prerequisite for perfect road infrastructure, outweighs the anticipated utility.
5. **Accident Reduction Skepticism**: Recent incidents involving SDCs in accidents have cast doubt on their ability to completely eliminate accidents, highlighting the risk of malfunctions and the challenge of human operators responding effectively in such situations.

**Conclusion**: While Self-Driving Cars represent an intriguing research concept, their real-world implementation is severely constrained by infrastructure, GPS availability, weather conditions, financial viability, and safety concerns. Successful implementation may be feasible in developed nations with controlled environments, but it remains impractical for global adoption at this juncture. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_84.txt,"Self-driving cars might still sound like something from a sci-fi story, but these automobiles are finding their way onto the road more and more. Companies such as Google are constantly testing out new self-driving technologies in an effort to decrease human error on the road and increase transportation efficiency. As with every technological advancement, though, the implementation of this research brings into question both the possible advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.

According to the article “Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars” from the Auto Insurance Center, there are a plethora of arguable points from both sides of the spectrum. The main argument the “pro” side presents is that self-driving cars will decrease the amount of human-related driving errors on the road while increasing the efficiency of transportation. Drivers would no longer have to worry about maintaining the speed of the car or paying attention to other drivers. 

This technology also enables drivers to have more freedom while traveling, whether the driver has a disability or is temporarily under the influence. This could result in a higher quality of life for everyone using self-driving transportation. 

The article also describes the “pro” point that many drivers have already adjusted to self-driving aspects such as “autonomous braking, self-parking, or sensors that clue a driver in to a nearby obstacle.” 

Self-driving cars also have the potential to save lives. They rectify the lingering issue of drunk or drug-influenced drivers who should not be operating normal motor vehicles. These advanced cars would also decrease distracted drivers or tired drivers on the road. This article cites the CDC and points out that “fatalities from traffic accidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people.” The impaired drivers mentioned previously contribute to this statistic. When unsafe drivers are taken out of the driver’s seat, the overall safety of people everywhere increases.
The “con” side has just as many points, though, with the main idea being how self-driving cars require drivers to give up a bit of autonomy and rely on technology. Technology will always have the potential to fail, and this could happen by way of short-circuiting, hacking or even human interference. A normal car, like what we are used to, can also fail, so that argument doesn’t quite stand on solid ground. The more we learn about what makes the best self-driving car, though, the safer and less likely to fail we can make the cars.

While I understand why so many are hesitant to commit entirely to a world where cars “think” for themselves, the benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. At its basic level of interpretation, self-driving cars represent exactly what technology strives for, and that is innovation. Technology innovates for the sake of generating a higher quality of life and bringing efficiency to everyday tasks. Self-driving cars allow people to stress less about the difficulties and potential consequences of commuting. When a passenger is no longer on high alert for internal or external driving mistakes, he or she has the ability to reflect on any other issues at hand. 

This technology also provides freedom for those who usually rely on public transportation or personal assistance when it comes to travelling. This may include people with physical or mental disabilities who cannot operate vehicles but would be able to get themselves from point a to point b with this technology. 

Some may argue that this technology is too expensive, but as more developments are made, companies will be able to find cost-effective production methods to make self-driving cars accessible to everyone.

While there will always be the “what ifs” of self-driving cars, we can’t let that stop us from innovating. With self-driving cars, commuters and pedestrians gain an increased sense of security and well-being.","

Self-driving cars, once a staple of science fiction, are increasingly becoming a reality on our roads. Companies like Google are tirelessly testing and refining autonomous technologies to mitigate human error and enhance transportation efficiency. As with any technological breakthrough, the implementation of self-driving cars sparks debates about both their advantages and disadvantages.

According to the Auto Insurance Center's article, ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars,"" there are numerous points to consider on both sides. The primary argument in favor of self-driving cars is that they will significantly reduce human-related driving errors, boosting transportation efficiency. With the burden of speed maintenance and monitoring other drivers lifted, commuters can enjoy a more relaxed travel experience.

This technology also promises to enhance mobility for individuals with disabilities and those temporarily incapacitated, potentially leading to a higher quality of life for all users of self-driving transportation. Notably, many drivers have already adapted to autonomous features like automatic braking, self-parking, and obstacle detection sensors, easing the transition to fully self-driving cars.

Moreover, self-driving cars have the potential to save thousands of lives by eliminating the risks associated with drunk, drug-influenced, distracted, or fatigued driving. Citing the CDC, the article highlights that over 33,000 annual traffic fatalities could be drastically reduced by removing unsafe drivers from the equation.

On the other hand, critics argue that self-driving cars require surrendering some autonomy to technology, which, like any system, can fail due to malfunctions, hacking, or human interference. However, as our understanding of optimal self-driving car design improves, so too will their safety and reliability.

While acknowledging the hesitation to embrace a world of autonomous vehicles, I firmly believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. At its core, self-driving car technology embodies the spirit of innovation, striving to enhance our daily lives and streamline tasks. By alleviating the stresses of commuting, self-driving cars grant passengers the freedom to focus on other aspects of their lives.

Furthermore, this technology offers unprecedented independence to those reliant on public transportation or personal assistance, including individuals with physical or mental disabilities who can now travel autonomously. Although initial costs may seem prohibitive, ongoing development will inevitably lead to more affordable production methods, making self-driving cars accessible to all.

Rather than letting hypothetical concerns hinder progress, we should continue innovating. With self-driving cars, both commuters and pedestrians can enjoy enhanced security and well-being, transforming the way we travel forever. "
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_39.txt,"The self-driving car is a groundbreaking piece of technology. There is no doubt about that. However, I really question how feasible it is to transition them into every day life in America. The potential advantages of self-driving cars are incredible. Safer driving would be accomplished by decreasing accidents due to the inability for a computer to get distracted and no longer needing a designated driver. The identification of traffic problems, faster speed limits and the ability to be dropped off would save people time. It would also save many individuals money due to lower insurance and healthcare costs. 

On the other hand, the disadvantages of self-driving cars are quite frightening:  they are weather dependent, they can't detect human traffic signals, they could malfunction and put the driver at even more risk, they rely on other pieces of technology we haven't yet mastered  and they would cause jobs in fields connected to transportation would suffer. In other words, there is no solid evidence that self-driving cars would be a true benefit to society.

In my opinion, I don't think it is the time to bring them out and try to adopt them into society. We need time to develop our technology to a point where if we were to start using them, they'd have a smooth transition into the market and outside parties would suffer as little as possible. I think they have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society but not right now.

If we were to start using them in today's society, it wouldn't work out in many ways. Only a small percentage of the population would be able to afford them as they would initially cost more than $100,000 and require time and resource-heavy training to operate in a safe manner. Furthermore, self-driving cars rely on being adopted by everybody and this will certainly not happen if only the richest people are able to buy them. This is because their safety is created only when the road consists of an entire network of driverless cars communicating with one another.  Security risks are also a relevant issue as hackers would be very interested in the technology and specialized computers could be able to collect personal data. 

Even if self-driving cars were cheap enough to be used by the general public, many jobs would be eliminated. Workers in the transportation sector would no longer be needed, the gasoline industry would suffer if self-driving cars are electric, driver's ed courses wouldn't be needed anymore and personal injury lawyers would have reduced earnings due to less accidents on the road. This would be detrimental for the lives of many people and also harm the economy. Because of these reasons, 1) I don' think it is feasible to get the general public to use self-driving cars and 2) in the unlikely case that everyone uses them, it would cause damage to the economy.  

Like many technological advances throughout history, self-driving cars have a thick silver lining.  In many cases, the technology is beneficial to outweigh all of its downsides, but in the case of driverless cars, we may not want to commit to it without further investigation.","

The self-driving car is indeed a groundbreaking innovation, but its feasibility in everyday American life is questionable. While its potential advantages are remarkable, including enhanced safety through reduced accidents, saved time via optimized traffic management, and cost savings on insurance and healthcare, the drawbacks are equally concerning.

Key disadvantages include weather dependency, inability to detect human traffic signals, potential malfunctions, reliance on unmastered technologies, and significant job losses in the transportation sector. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to confirm that self-driving cars would unequivocally benefit society.

In my opinion, the time is not ripe for their widespread adoption. Further technological development is necessary to ensure a seamless integration into the market, minimizing disruptions to external parties. Although self-driving cars hold immense potential, it is not yet realized.

Immediate implementation in today's society would face numerous challenges. Initially priced over $100,000, only a small percentage of the population could afford them, necessitating time-consuming and resource-intensive training for safe operation. Widespread adoption is crucial for their safety, relying on a network of communicating driverless cars, but this is unlikely if only the affluent can access them. Additionally, security risks from hackers and data collection by specialized computers pose significant concerns.

Even if made affordable for the general public, self-driving cars would lead to substantial job losses in the transportation sector, negatively impact the gasoline industry if electric, render driver's education obsolete, and reduce personal injury lawyers' earnings due to fewer accidents. This would have detrimental effects on many lives and the economy.

For two primary reasons, I argue against the feasibility of widespread self-driving car adoption: 1) low likelihood of public acceptance and 2) potential economic harm even if universally adopted. Like many historical technological advances, self-driving cars have a promising yet problematic outlook, warranting cautious, in-depth examination before commitment.@

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_43.txt,"

After decades of remarkable advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), we've witnessed transformative benefits across various domains, including medicine, e-commerce, and digital devices. The latest AI-driven innovation poised to revolutionize our lives is the self-driving car industry.

As we witness the evolution of self-driving cars, we're compelled to examine the ongoing debate surrounding their merits and drawbacks. Despite the technology not being fully realized, discussions about their impact are rampant. With industry giants like Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, and Tencent heavily investing in self-driving car research, it's intriguing to assess whether these vehicles are a groundbreaking gift or a double-edged sword. 

In this article, we firmly believe that self-driving cars are indeed a revolutionary boon.

The benefits of self-driving cars are numerous, with two key advantages standing out. Firstly, they significantly enhance driving safety. While mechanical faults can sometimes cause accidents, human error is the predominant culprit. As emphasized by Chris Urmson, Google's Director of the Self-Driving Car Program, ""These vehicles are more courteous and defensive drivers than normal drivers."" Computers, utilizing meticulously designed algorithms to determine optimal stopping distances and vehicle proximity, drastically reduce the likelihood of car accidents.

Secondly, self-driving cars empower individuals who face significant mobility challenges. For the handicapped, intoxicated, or elderly, these vehicles offer unparalleled autonomy, minimizing their reliance on public transportation or external assistance.

Despite the evident benefits, some critics raise concerns about potential risks. We'll address two contentious issues, which, in our opinion, are not insurmountable problems.

Firstly, the concern about personal data collection by self-driving car computers is valid. However, as we move towards a more interconnected world through the Internet of Things (IoT), designed to enhance our lives, self-driving cars are merely a component of this broader ecosystem. We're confident that future advancements will significantly bolster private data protection.

Secondly, the argument that self-driving cars will eradicate jobs in the transportation sector, particularly in freight and taxi services, is a short-term concern. While this may temporarily impact unemployment rates and the economy, we must prioritize long-term progress. Halting self-driving car development due to job market concerns would mean forfeiting opportunities for transformative advancements in transportation and the economy.

In conclusion, let us wholeheartedly embrace the promising future of self-driving cars and prepare to embark on a revolutionary journey, safely buckled up in a self-driving vehicle! ","After decades of prosperous advances of artificial intelligence (AI), we have benefited tremendously from AI on a variety of domains such as medicine, e-commerce and digit devices. Another futuristic industry driven by AI is gradually stepping to people's life: self-driving cars.

We are the history viewers of how self-driving cars are right changing our transportation choices. As the name indicates, self-driving cars can move in a controlled manner without any operation of human. Alongside the technology of self-driving cars that has emerged during this time while not yet fully realized, the debate on the pros vs. cons of self-driving cars has already started to rage on. Whether it is a gift from God, or just another devil jumping out from Pandora's Box? People hold different ideas. But are self-driving cars really that controversial? If they are, then why hundreds of huge companies, including Google, Apple, Audi, Baidu, Tencent, are now dramatically ""wasting"" their money on the research of self-driving cars?

In this article we certainly believe that self-driving ARE the most beautiful gifts endowed by our God.

There are uncountable benefits of self-driving cars. Among them there are two prominent ones. The first regards on the driving safety. While surely some faulty mechanics can be cited as the cause for certain accidents, more often than not drivers themselves are the most dangerous things about hitting the open road. Google's director of the self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, says the company's vehicles are better all around: ""They are more courteous and more defensive drivers than normal drivers."" Indeed, a computer is actually an ideal motorist, as it uses carefully designed algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle and other data that can decrease significantly the chance of car accidents.

The second advantage is that self-driving cars can benefit those people in desperate help. One fact is that self-driving cars can help people move freely who are not suited to driving, such as the handicapped, the drunk or senior citizens. With self-driving cars, their reliance on public transportation or assistance from others to get around would become very minimal.

Apart from the obvious benefits, there are pessimistic people who may be bothered by some potential risks brought by self-driving cars. Here we would list out two of the most controversial issues which, however, are not problems at all, in our opinion.

Firstly of all, some individuals are concerned about the chance that a computer built into the self-driving car can collect personal data. Indeed, we have that risk. However, in the future with the development of computers and AI, every device or item in our life will get electronicalized and the information of them will flow through the internet of things (IOT), which is designed to make our life more intelligent. Self-driving cars are only a small portion of it and thus the personal data problem is not specific to it. Further, we believe in the future the protection of private data will be enhanced significantly.

Second, people argue ""self-driving cars would eliminate many jobs in the transportation sector, especially when it comes to freight transportation and taxi drivers."" Indeed, this could have a impact on the unemployment rate and the economy. Nevertheless, this negative effect is short-term. For the sake of long-term advancement of human history, we need self-driving cars. If we stop the development of self-driving cars just because of the worry on the unemployment rate, then people lose the opportunity to improve our transportation and economy in the long run.

Therefore, let us embrace the bright future of self-driving cars and just get ready to buckle up in a self-driving car!"

The integration of self-driving cars has sparked intense debate across mainstream media outlets, yet a nuanced examination reveals a preponderance of benefits that outweigh the disadvantages. While concerns about the software's cost and technological failures are valid, they can be mitigated through innovative solutions. The advantages, including a potential drastic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, decreased car insurance costs, and the alleviation of rush hour traffic, significantly outweigh the drawbacks.

**Addressing the Disadvantages:**

1. **Software Cost:** Federal tax credits, similar to those offered for electric vehicles (e.g., California's up to $7,500 cap), could incentivize purchases and offset costs, potentially leading to a decline in insurance premiums.
2. **Technological Failures:** Implementing a manual override switch would enable drivers to take control during emergencies, ensuring safety while maintaining the vehicle's protective software.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Enhanced Safety:** With approximately 80% of accidents attributed to human error, often due to distraction or impairment, self-driving cars would substantially reduce crash rates.
2. **Economic Benefits:** Decreased accidents would lead to lower car insurance premiums for all drivers. Manufacturers could insure the software, offering smaller, supplemental insurance plans for manual driving instances.
3. **Increased Mobility and Efficiency:**
	* **Platooning and Vehicle Communication:** Reducing inter-vehicle distances and coordinating traffic flow could drastically decrease congestion, increasing travel time efficiency.
	* **Enhanced Productivity and Happiness:** Chauffeured commutes would provide professionals with more time for personal and family life, potentially increasing overall well-being and work productivity.
	* **Inclusivity for the Disabled and Elderly:** Self-driving cars would offer unparalleled mobility, enabling these groups to explore and engage with their communities in ways previously inaccessible.

**Conclusion:**
The multifaceted benefits of self-driving cars, including reduced fees, lower insurance premiums, enhanced safety, and increased access, position this technology for a profoundly positive impact on society. As the technology evolves and integrates into our infrastructure, its advantages will increasingly overshadow its disadvantages, potentially leading to widespread adoption within generations, provided it is developed with long-term societal enhancement in mind. ","The advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars have become a hot topic of discussion a mainstream media outlets, but there are clear advantages and even fairly simple solutions to the potential disadvantages that suggest the benefits of this technology. There are many perceived disadvantages stated by those who doubt the potential benefits this advancement could have on modern life. These more reasonable issues foreseen include the sheer cost of the software and the potential risk associated with technological failures outside of the car. However, are far more advantages that greatly outweigh any potential negative associated with this revolutionary technology. These advantages include: a potential dramatic reduction in crashes caused by distracted or impaired drivers, a potential decrease in car insurance costs which could be financially beneficial to the owners in the long run, and the potential for this software to remove the potential of rush hour traffic and provide people with lower-income and/or mobility an option to move around a city. 
The cost of the software will likely be the primary obstacle for car companies attempting to flood the market with self-driving cars. However, as some states have done with electric vehicles, there could be an opportunity for federal tax credits, such as in California where one can receive a tax credit up to a cap of $7500. Due to a substantial decline in insurance costs for self-driving cars, the potential for a tax credit to incentivise purchase from the general public is high. Other sceptics have shed light on the possibility of self-driving cars to fail in circumstances where a loss of power has shut off traffic signals. This issue could be overcome by providing a manual override switch so the driver may take control of the vehicle to avoid any obstacles while keeping the basic safety software active in the event of a potential accident. 
Around 80% of accidents on the road are caused by human error, and a majority of the accidents caused by human error that can be linked to driving while distracted, either by a phone, conversation, events happening outside the vehicle, or driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This technology would greatly decrease the number of accidents due to these factors as people under the influence of these factors would have no direct role in the control of the vehicle. Paired with this decrease in crashes is the potential for a decrease in car insurance premiums and fees for all drivers. As roads become safer and accidents rarer, there would be a decreased responsibility for consumers to purchase car insurance and manufacturers of the vehicles could Insure the software controlling the car, which would just leave a potential smaller insurance plan for drivers who might take control of the vehicle. Lastly, the potential of platooning, which decreases the distance between vehicles to increase road capacity, and communications between all self-driving cars in an area could dramatically reduce the presence of traffic buildups on off-ramps which would, in turn, substantially increase travel time for all commuters. This decrease in travel time, paired with the time the professionals would have during their chauffeured commute, could allow them to spend more time on aspects of life arguably more important than work, i.e. family life, good mental and physical health, and personal projects, which could overall increase happiness and productivity while at work and at home. This role of self-driving cars to chauffeur their owners from point A to point B could also be utilized by the percentage of the population with limited mobility and would allow them to explore their city and perform tasks that they otherwise would not be able to perform due to their inability to operate a vehicle. 
Decreased fees, lower insurance premiums, safer roads, and increased access are just a few of the many potential benefits a community could experience from this technology. The theoretical see-saw that exemplifies this debate can be pushed in either direction, however as the technology advances and is updated to become a part of our country's infrastructure the benefits will surely outweigh the disadvantages. As long as this technology is created for the long run and not thought of as a short-term solution, it could easily become engrained within our society within generations."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_3.txt,"

Self-driving cars, despite their relatively short development period, have advanced rapidly and garnered significant public attention. The debate surrounding their integration into our automotive environment and their desirability for society is ongoing, with passionate arguments on both sides. This essay aims to provide convincing evidence that, while self-driving cars pose potential societal risks, their capacity to alleviate the numerous negative impacts associated with human-driven cars makes their implementation a rational choice, given the significant flaws in our current system.

**Human Fallibility Behind the Wheel**

The propensity for human error is a compelling reason to reconsider our reliance on human drivers. Daily, we drive without sufficient rest, overlook blind spots, and succumb to distractions from our mobile devices. With approximately 33,000 annual fatal accidents attributed largely to human error, it is indisputable that improvement is necessary.

**Addressing Skepticism and Safety Concerns**

While skepticism towards self-driving cars is understandable, given their developmental stage, there are valid reasons to believe that even in mixed computer-human traffic environments, self-driving cars could prove safer. Unlike human drivers, who may become complacent over time, self-driving cars can be designed to enhance safety through continuous improvement. Moreover, they are immune to distractions, sleep deprivation, intoxication, and time pressures, significantly reducing risks. Although they may not intuitively understand human drivers' behaviors, their risk-free operation could still yield safer outcomes.

**Societal Impact: Employment and Inequality**

Others are concerned about the broader societal implications, particularly job displacement in the transportation sector and potential exacerbation of economic inequality due to the high cost of ownership. However, the challenge of job displacement is not unique to self-driving cars but a broader issue stemming from technological advancements. If society can develop support systems for workers displaced by technology in various sectors, it is reasonable to assume similar solutions can be applied to the transportation industry.

**Mitigating Inequality with Proper Implementation**

Properly implemented, self-driving vehicles could actually reduce economic inequality. Automation in the transportation industry, while detrimental to workers, could lead to lower commodity prices, benefiting many. Furthermore, an automated public transportation system could offer flexible, convenient, and accessible services, relieving the economic and logistical burdens associated with vehicle ownership and navigating complex public transit systems. This could effectively democratize access to jobs, healthcare, and enrichment opportunities, counteracting the de-facto restrictions currently in place.

**Conclusion: A Different but Potentially Improved Society**

A society embracing self-driving cars will undoubtedly look different. The success or failure of this integration hinges on how it is implemented. While guaranteed outcomes are elusive, considering the profound limitations of our current system, it is reasonable to assert that self-driving cars could bring about substantial improvements. ","Self-driving cars, though only recently becoming a technological feasibility, have advanced rapidly in their short time of development and have thoroughly captured the public eye. The debate on their fitness to our automotive environment and on their desirableness to our society as a whole is raging onward with impassioned argument on both sides. In this essay I will aim to provide convincing evidence that, though they have the potential to cause societal harm, given the distressing array of negative societal impacts associated with human-driven cars, the apparent feasibility for self-driving cars to ameliorate these issues makes it only rational to welcome their implementation.  

To start with, consider the fallibility of human drivers. On a regular basis we turn on our engines without sufficient sleep, absentmindedly forget to check blind-spots, and allow our attention to be torn from the road by the slightest of mobile vibrations. With an estimated 33,000 annual fatal accidents and overwhelming evidence that human error accounts for a significant number of these, it seems incontrovertible that we should do better. 

While no one would rightly argue that our current system is ideal, skepticism toward self-driving cars at this stage is more than fair. The development of the vehicles is very much still in its developmental phases and without a fully computerized automotive environment computer-human scuffles could arise more often than current human-human scuffles do. While a definitive answer to this question would require currently non-existent empirical studies, there are good reasons to believe that even in computer-human interactions the computer would be the better bet.  Whereas human drivers tend to fall into a lull of false confidence after driving for many years, self-driving cars can be designed to improve and become more safe over time. Further, there is no distraction, no sleep deprivation, no intoxication, and no frantic concern for being late to take a self-driving car away from the task of safely getting from point A to point B. In the absence of such risks, a computer car very well might behave safer even without the ability to intuitively grasp tendencies and perceptions of neighboring human drivers. 

Others however, are more concerned about the societal impact of these cars than their safety specs. Even if the change means less lives lost on the road, it still may be an unwise one if it leads to the ruin of lives off the road. Given the number of transportation jobs, a computerized revolution could displace the occupations of many currently employed drivers. Furthermore, given the massive economic investment needed to own such a car, might this lead the widening of already egregious inequality gaps in the country?

The transportation industry represents a real threat if we have no place for the newly unemployed to turn. This however, is not a problem unique to self-driving cars but one that is encroaching on us from all directions with the rapid advance of technological competency. If we cannot as a society, solve this more generally, the threats will be realized even in the absence of the driver-less car revolution; if we do find a way to support the displaced workers of other sectors I remain hopeful that such approaches can be implemented to this sector as well. 

As for societal inequality, self-driving vehicles, if implemented properly, could actually be a great boon to economically struggling classes. To begin, the previously considered transportation industry automation, though bad for workers, could be fantastic for commodity prices. If the cost of all daily goods dropped, many would be the better for it. Further, current systems of public transportation are woefully insufficient to serve their desired societal role. When jobs, hospitals, and enrichment events are inconvenient to access, attendance from under serviced individuals tends to drop. This creates a de-facto restriction on who may access what. With an automated public transportation system, it could be much easier to introduce flexible pick-up locations, drop-off spots, and schedules. With a more functional and convenient public transportation system we could relieve both the economic burden of buying a vehicle as well as the logistical burden of navigating tricky and time-consuming bus routes.  

A society which supports self-driving cars would certainly look different from ours. How we implement them will determine much of their success and failure. For that reason it is not a guaranteed success, however, looking at the massive limitations and problems with our current system, it does not seem to be a stretch to claim that this could bring us dramatic improvements."

There are significant advantages and disadvantages to integrating self-driving cars into our society. The primary benefits of self-driving cars are enhanced safety and reduced costs. By eliminating the human element, self-driving cars mitigate the risks associated with distracted driving, such as texting or falling asleep at the wheel. Additionally, their programmed ability to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid collisions would lead to a substantial decrease in car accidents. This, in turn, would translate to considerable cost savings, as highlighted by the US Department of Transportation's valuation of a human life at $9.2 million, thereby reducing high insurance and healthcare expenditures stemming from car accidents.

A notable drawback of self-driving cars is their exorbitant cost, potentially limiting their adoption to a small, affluent segment of the population. With estimated prices upwards of $100,000, only a minority might be able to afford them, meaning that a significant portion of accidents caused by distracted driving would persist, and the anticipated cost savings would not materialize.

Ultimately, self-driving cars would vastly benefit society, primarily by reducing distracted driving, which would decrease car accidents and save lives. In an era where technology aims to better our society, the life-saving potential of self-driving cars presents a compelling reason for their adoption. Given the alarming rate of car accident fatalities (approximately 33,000 annually, as per the CDC), with most attributed to distracted driving, self-driving cars offer a solution by eliminating human distractions. Although the initial cost of developing and purchasing self-driving cars may seem prohibitive, ongoing technological advancements and manufacturing updates could eventually make them accessible to all. To prevent unnecessary fatalities, society should at least explore the implementation of self-driving cars, as the long-term benefits, including the priceless value of saving lives, would outweigh the initial costs and waiting period for widespread affordability.","There are many advantages and disadvantages for using self-driving cars in our society today. The overall advantages of self-driving cars are that they are safer and cheaper. Self-driving cars would be safer because they would eliminate the human element of distracted driving, caused by talking on the cell phone or falling asleep at the wheel. They would also be safer because they would decrease car accidents by being programmed to stop at a safe distance from other vehicles and avoid serious collisions. In addition, self-driving cars would be cheaper because it would save money from all the accidents it would have prevented. As the article mentioned, the US Department of Transportation values every human life at $9.2 million and self-driving cars would prevent many of the high insurance and healthcare costs that develop because of car accidents. 

One big disadvantage of self-driving cars are the cost for them, which may prevent a majority of the population from using them once they become available. For instance, it was estimated the cost for a self-driving car was upwards of $100,000, making it a luxury item that only the upper class would be able to afford. If only a smaller percentage of the population utilize self-driving cars, then a majority of car accidents caused by distracted driving would still occur and no money would be saved at all. 

Overall, self-driving cars would be a huge benefit for society. The main factor that would deem self-driving cars an advantage rather than a disadvantage for our society would be the aspect of decreasing distracted driving which would thus decrease car accidents and save lives. In a world where technological advancements are created for the betterment of our society, what better reason to use self-driving cars if they can save lives? Car accidents have always occurred since they were first created, and are too common in our society with the CDC reporting an average of 33,000 fatalities occurring from car accidents yearly. While most of those car accents are caused by distracted driving, self-driving cars would eliminate that problem entirely because the computers controlling the vehicles would have no way of experiencing the same distractions as humans. Yes, the cost of creating the complex technology for self-driving cars and then selling them to individuals may seem high at first, but as new technology is constantly updated and manufactured, self-driving cars can one day be affordable for everyone. Society needs to at least try to utilize self-driving cars to prevent unnecessary deaths because although it may take years before more individuals can be able to afford the self-driving vehicle, it will all be worth it if you just imagine being able to spend a little more time with someone you lost due to a car accident."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_34.txt,"Even though many of us believe that technological advances have made our society more convenient and efficient in a variety of areas, including communication tools, shopping experiences, and personalized online streaming services, there has always been controversy on whether the technology is making our society better or worse. Drastic changes that technologies can bring to our lives are sometimes not easily accepted by society due to the potential disadvantages that might make our lives worse. One of such controversial topics currently being discussed is self-driving cars. Academic institutions and industry have started testing the practical use of the self-driving technology, but as the self-driving technology can potentially risk human's life by causing more car accidents, people are more concerned and skeptical about its use. While I admit that the risk can be high, I believe that the self-driving technology can create more opportunities for people having a variety of difficulties and help detect ""errors"" easily which can improve the technology continuously.

First, self-driving cars can be useful not only for ordinal people like us but also disabled people, pregnant women, and other people having a difficulty driving a car. These people, because they cannot drive a car, need to use public transportations or assistance when they go shopping, travel, and/or commute, which can be particularly hard especially in a location where public transportation is not developed and/or in busy cities and downtowns where other people are in hurry.

Self-driving cars can provide a new, better, and personalized way for those people who cannot drive and have trouble using public transportations. Although there are several risks associated with self-driving cars, including the inability of operating safely in a variety of weather conditions and traffic situations, we still do not know whether these risks are higher than those associated with human drivers, such as distraction, drinking, and sleeping during driving. In other words, there is always a risk when driving a car, regardless of the use of the self-driving technology. When there is no evidence that self-driving cars cause more accidents, it is reasonable and more important to promote self-driving cars which can create a better transportation opportunity for people having a hard time driving and using other means of transportation.

Furthermore, the risks mentioned above can be minimized as we collect data. One of the advantages of self-driving cars is that, when an accident occurs, analysis of data can reveal the cause of the accident. This means that the algorithm will be improved and therefore a new algorithm will likely prevent a similar accident in the future. It is almost impossible to detect the exact cause when an accident occurs due to a human error. Even when we detect factors that caused the accident, the immediate improvement would not happen. A variety of educational programs and policy changes have been implemented to prevent car accidents, but such changes require time to prove their actual impact.

In conclusion, I believe that introducing self-driving cars can provide new opportunities for those having difficulty driving and using other transportations and risks associated with the self-driving technologies can be minimized as we collect data, which can decrease the number of car accidents and therefore offer a better experience for people.","

Even though technological advancements have transformed various aspects of our lives, including communication, shopping, and entertainment, their overall impact on society remains a topic of debate. One contentious issue is the introduction of self-driving cars, with concerns centered around potential accidents. While acknowledging these risks, I firmly believe that self-driving technology can greatly benefit individuals with difficulties and facilitate continuous improvement through error detection.

**Enhanced Accessibility for All**
Self-driving cars can revolutionize transportation for not only the general public but also for individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, and those struggling with driving. Currently, these groups rely on underdeveloped public transportation systems or assistance, which can be particularly challenging in areas with limited public transit options or in bustling cities. Self-driving cars offer a personalized, superior alternative, mitigating the hardships associated with traditional transportation methods.

**Risk Assessment and Comparative Analysis**
Although self-driving cars pose risks, such as operational challenges in varied weather and traffic conditions, it is crucial to compare these to the risks associated with human drivers, including distractions, driving under the influence, and fatigue. Since there is no conclusive evidence suggesting self-driving cars cause more accidents, prioritizing their development is reasonable, especially considering the potential benefits for those with driving difficulties.

**Data-Driven Risk Mitigation and Improvement**
The risks associated with self-driving cars can be significantly minimized through data collection. A key advantage of this technology is the ability to analyze accident causes through data, leading to algorithm enhancements that prevent similar incidents in the future. In contrast, identifying the exact cause of human error-induced accidents is often challenging, and even when causes are determined, implementing corrective measures can be time-consuming and may not yield immediate results.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, introducing self-driving cars can unlock new transportation opportunities for individuals facing driving challenges, while the associated risks can be effectively reduced through data-driven improvements. This, in turn, can lead to a decrease in car accidents, ultimately enhancing the overall driving experience for everyone. "

The Evolution of Transportation: A Critical Examination of Self-Driving Cars

Unlike bicycles, which have undergone significant transformations over time, cars have maintained a relatively consistent design. However, the emergence of self-driving cars is poised to revolutionize the automotive industry. With several models already tested on public roads, the debate surrounding their benefits and drawbacks has intensified.

Proponents of autonomous vehicles argue that they will drastically reduce fatal car crashes, as machines are immune to distractions, intoxication, and other human errors. Additionally, they cite the potential for coordinated speed management and optimized traffic flow, leading to decreased congestion and travel times. Furthermore, self-driving cars could greatly benefit the disabled and elderly, providing unparalleled mobility. Once a substantial proportion of vehicles on the road are autonomous, advocates claim that society as a whole will reap numerous benefits, including saved lives, reduced financial losses, lower fuel consumption, and decreased need for traffic enforcement.

However, despite the allure of this technology, I must side with the critics. Several pressing concerns undermine the predicted advantages:

1. **Economic Viability**: Establishing a highly secure, interconnected network for data exchange between vehicles will be prohibitively costly. As highlighted by The Guardian, the risk of hacking poses a significant threat. The production costs of these complex vehicles will be substantially higher than their traditional counterparts. Even with a reduced accident rate, the increased damage to expensive autonomous cars and the need for specialized repair staff and customer support will incur significant expenses, casting doubt on their cost-efficiency.

2. **Scalability and Adoption**: The touted benefits of autonomous cars are contingent upon their widespread adoption. With only a small percentage of self-driving cars on the road, the effects on safety, traffic coordination, and congestion will be negligible. In fact, the presence of a few autonomous vehicles among human drivers could lead to accidents caused by human misinterpretation of their behavior. The advantages will only materialize once a substantial portion of the population adopts this technology.

3. **Societal Acceptance**: The high cost of autonomous cars may render them a luxury item, limiting their adoption. Additionally, people's natural aversion to drastic change, the perceived loss of control, and ethical concerns (e.g., programming cars to prioritize minimizing fatalities by potentially endangering their own passengers) may hinder the transition to driverless traffic.

**In Conclusion**: While acknowledging the engineering feat, I believe society is not yet ready for this revolution. The concerns surrounding economic viability, scalability, and societal acceptance must be thoroughly addressed before self-driving cars can truly transform our transportation landscape. For now, we may need to tolerate the status quo for a couple more decades. ","Bicycles have seen an evolution akin to those in biology, starting with extremely disproportionate wheels, experimenting with bizarre rider positions, ... Cars, on the other hand, have always been the same: four same-sized wheels, a bumpy body, doors, windshield, and a steering wheel. However, something on the horizon might turn everything about cars upside down: self-driving cars.

Several models have been tested on streets already and that settles the question from engineering and technological point of view. It fuels the debate about their promises and threats to the society.

Proponents of automated cars argue that self-driving cars will eliminate the stunning number of fatal car crashes, because the cold-blooded machines will not be distracted by music, a passer-by, or be under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The other feature they cite is the possibility for many, or even all, cars in a certain city to communicate with one another to coordinate the speed levels, and red light waits so as to achieve the maximum flow and minimum travel times. Automated cars, they say, will allow for more cars to drive next to each other, due to their precision in maneuvering, and yet lead to less congestion. Another major advantage will be their service to the disabled and elderly people. Once a good proportion of cars on the street become self-drivers, the advocates claim that the whole society will benefit: saving lives, avoiding financial setbacks from car accidents, less fuel consumption, fewer traffic police officers on duty, etc.

As utopian as the technology seems, I have to side with the critics of the technology. There are several serious issues with the predictions above.

Firstly, self-driving cars will not necessarily be economical. There will be need for an extremely cyber secure and delicate network of interconnected software that store and communicate data between cars. If, as Guardian suggests, there is a potential for hackers to manipulate such a system, then it will be a true disaster. Achieving a high level of security could be prohibitively costly, overshadowing any amount of saving on gasoline. The manufacturing of the cars will require complex software and hardware and production cost will be higher than the average today. Even with the autonomous cars driving accidents could and will occur. Maybe the number of accidents will be lower, but remember that the damage befallen on these expensive cars will be higher. There are other expenses we can foresee: staff that can repair the cars, customer service that can help out a baffled and helpless human passenger in a car,... Therefore, it is not clear whether self-driving cars will in fact be cost-efficient.

Secondly,  the pros listed for autonomous cars are all predicated on the hope that they will come in large quantities. The effect of having cars coordinate their paths will not be felt if they substitute only 2% of all the cars out there. Same holds true for safety. Self-driving cars can reduce the number of accidents only if they make up a significant percentage of all traffic. A handful of them among human drivers could in fact lead to human misinterpretation of their behavior and lead to accidents. Imagine a driverless car passing by inches by your car at a high speed. It could be that the machine ""knows"" what it's doing, but what if the human driver makes the mistake under the panic he or she experiences? Again, the advantages of autonomous cars will begin to take effect only after a good portion of the society adopts them.

And will the society in fact adopt them? As mentioned above, the merits of self-driving cars are dependent on their taking up a good portion of the traffic. If they don't, then they can turn into clumsy, ultra cautious drivers that we all hate so much! People have good reasons to not embrace the technology -- number one being their cost. Cars are already expensive and if the autonomous cars cannot compete with the traditional ones in terms of cost, they will remain a luxury item. Other reasons may include people natural phobia of drastic changes. We do hear people not willing to ""give up the control"" and ""joy of driving"". Such personal associations with cars and ethical issues (such as cars being programmed to minimize fatalities in an eventful situation by ""directing the danger toward its own passengers"") may turn out to be strong concerns for people that come in te way of transition to a driverless traffic.

In summary, despite my praise for the engineering accomplishment, I do not believe that the society is ready for this revolution just yet. We may have to tolerate the boring junkers for a couple more decades."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_77.txt,"

The term ""Self-Driving Car"" inherently conveys both benefits and concerns. In my opinion, the most significant advantage is its potential to optimize traffic flow by enabling cars to drive closely together while maintaining safety. This is achieved through advanced sensors that continuously monitor and adjust the distance between adjacent vehicles, eliminating human error. As a result, more cars can share the road simultaneously, reducing congestion and the risk of accidents, which often occur when humans misjudge safe distances.

Conversely, the concept of Self-Driving Cars also sparks fear, particularly in the gasoline industry. The shift towards electric self-driving cars could indeed lead to a decline in gasoline demand, potentially reducing the industry's net profit. However, this transition also signifies a move towards a more environmentally friendly alternative, as electricity is a cleaner energy source compared to gasoline.

The environmental benefits of Self-Driving Cars are multifaceted and significantly impact societal well-being. By reducing time spent on the road, these vehicles decrease energy consumption and lower emissions, contributing to cleaner air. This, in turn, fosters a healthier environment, as increased oxygen levels enhance the body's energy production, leading to improved long-term health outcomes.

Furthermore, the electric nature of Self-Driving Cars, as opposed to the polluting aspects of gasoline, not only cleans the air but also protects the land. The elimination of gasoline refueling reduces the risk of spills, which can lead to devastating fires and soil contamination, ultimately affecting the health of the land's inhabitants. Thus, Self-Driving Cars play a crucial role in maintaining a clean environment, directly contributing to the betterment of public health.

In conclusion, considering the potential for optimized traffic, reduced environmental pollution, and the resultant health benefits, I firmly believe that Self-Driving Cars will usher in numerous societal advantages, with improved public health being a paramount outcome. ","The name, Self-Driving Car, in itself elicit advantages, but then also fear and therefore some disadvantages. However, in my own view, the most important advantage is that this new technology makes it easier for cars to drive close together continuously and still have flowing traffic. This is to say, the continuously aware sensor judges the practiced distance between adjacent cars, not the human. This implies that the method in which cars drive close together to reduce traffic is not hazardous. The program determines the safe minimum distance and then as a result, more cars can be on the road at the same time without having slow car flow or slow traffic. As experience shows, sometimes humans misestimate the safe minimum distance and this can lead to wasted space on the road or car crashes. One can then see that not only can the roads be more efficient for travel, but also reduction in car crashes can make the roads less dangerous.  

As mentioned before, the name, Self-Driving Cars, can also elicit fearer. One such fearer is the gasoline industry. Many in this field may reason that if the self-driving car is electric, the demand for gasoline will decline. Those who reason as such are not far from the truth.  If there is less of a demand for gasoline fuel, these industries are indeed at risk for reduction in their net profit. Unfortunately, for advocates of the gasoline industry, the imagery of “new and improved” does include electricity as the new and improved from gasoline fuel. Many might come to recognize that electricity power is a form of “new and improved” because it is friendlier for the environment than “gasoline fuel.” 

If one has lived long enough, one can recognize the value of good relationships not just with other people but also with the environment. It almost relates to the nature vs. nurture debate. Social and environmental factors determine our personalities. This opinion is important because Self-driving cars are beneficial to society because they improve the quality of environmental factors. In other words, Self-driving cars make the air “healthier” by reducing the carbon dioxide content. If there is more oxygen with which our bodies can produce energy, then in the long-term the people in this environment can have healthier states of homeostasis. For example, the reference paper argued that Self-driving cars would reduce the time that cars on the road. If the cars on the road for less time, this means that, the energy used would emit less waste. This then can render the air more free of waste over time, and the people using the air healthier.
Finally, the electric nature of the cars compared to the dirty nature of gasoline would make the environment cleaner. Yes, I have introduced in the previous section the idea of less time for gas emission waste and/or electric emission waste equates to cleaner air. Not only does the fuel affect air’s cleanliness but also land’s cleanliness. For example, I have a made the mistake a few times of spilling gas on the floor while refueling my vehicle. If there was an adjacent fire nearby, a ""small, careless” mistake could have become a great fire. This fire would affect land’s cleanliness. An unclean land can affect the inhabitants of the land. Self-driving cars can help prevent such incidents that can make the land unclean. A cleaner land and air can make the people healthier. Therefore, “Self driving cars” can help move society forward to better health. 

For the reasons demonstrating how society can live in a cleaner environment thereby benefiting from self-driving cars, I strongly believe self-driving cars would allow several societal advantages to start sprouting, and one of those advantages is better health."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_10.txt,"The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars"", provides an in depth look into the reasoning of whether or not we, as a society, should adopt self-driving vehicles.  Of the 20 ""pros"" listed, an increase in safety was likely the leading factor, but also included were the benefits in commute times and city travel, the possibility for the driver to do something productive in the time that would otherwise be used for driving, and the idea that elderly or disabled people would be able to ride self-driving cars without worry.  However, in contrast to the advantages listed in the article, the author also offered 20 disadvantages.  Many of these focused on the training involved in learning how to operate it, the high cost, security issues (both personal and cybersecurity), legal ramifications, the fact that a self-driving vehicle will not be able to appropriately respond to all situations and other technical hangups,and the financial implications caused by uprooting an old industry.

Given this article and other available literature and research focused on self-driving vehicles, I truly believe a gradual implementation into our society would be quite beneficial. When weighing the ""pros"" and ""cons"" in order to gauge whether adopting self-driving cars would be beneficial to society, it is important to look at the whole picture.  The ""pros"" are all valid currently and it appears that they will still be valid moving forward, while many of the ""cons"" can be addressed as the self-driving vehicles further develop.  For example, the high initial cost is cited as a reason against adopting these vehicles.  However, what isn't taken into consideration in this case is the fact that new technologies typically drastically drop in price over a short amount of time.  We often hear the story of the first computers being the size of an entire room and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time.  However, in a few tens of years the price of those computers came down enough that many families could afford them.  I believe a similar situation could occur with the sensor and computer package required in self-driving vehicles.  As a second example, cybersecurity has become a very hot topic recently and appears in the ""cons"" against these vehicles.  However, several very critical pieces of infrastructure are operated and they have been largely protected against cybersecurity attacks.  Take for example remote controlled drones currently in use by the military.  The risk of a cyber attack is definitely present, but the designers have found a way to adequately protect the devices.  Something similar could be done for self-driving vehicles. Although several more examples supporting the idea that many of the present ""cons"" seen in self-driving vehicle adoption can be corrected in the future are present, it is unnecessary seeing that they are quite similar.  

However, what is important to notice is that all of the ""pros"" do not seem as if they will be changing, even as the vehicles themselves improve.  From my viewpoint, integrating self-driving cars into society should make driving safer and will allow for lower commute times, better access for the elderly and disabled, and the opportunity for the driver to accomplish something else in the time that would otherwise be wasted by driving.","

The article ""Top 20 Pros and Cons Associated With Self-Driving Cars"" provides a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of adopting autonomous vehicles. Upon examining the listed advantages, increased safety, reduced commute times, enhanced productivity during travel, and improved mobility for the elderly and disabled stand out as key benefits. Conversely, the article highlights 20 disadvantages, including training requirements, high upfront costs, security concerns (both personal and cybersecurity), legal implications, technical limitations, and the potential economic disruption to traditional industries.

After considering this article and additional research on self-driving cars, I firmly believe that a gradual integration into our society would be highly beneficial. When evaluating the pros and cons, it's essential to consider the broader context. The listed advantages remain pertinent and are likely to endure, whereas many of the disadvantages can be mitigated as the technology advances. For instance, the initial high cost, often cited as a deterrent, tends to decrease significantly over time, as exemplified by the rapid price drop of early computers. Similarly, cybersecurity concerns, although valid, can be effectively addressed, as seen in the protection of critical infrastructure like military drones.

Notably, the benefits of self-driving cars appear to be more stable and less susceptible to change as the technology improves. From my perspective, incorporating self-driving cars into society will likely enhance road safety, reduce commute times, provide greater accessibility for vulnerable populations, and offer drivers the opportunity to utilize their time more productively. A phased implementation would allow for the refinement of the technology, addressing concerns while harnessing the numerous benefits, ultimately leading to a safer, more efficient, and more inclusive transportation system.

Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_58.txt,"

The relentless progress of technology often sparks societal debate, with even seemingly minor innovations, like the shift from chalk to pencil in schools, generating public discussion. It's no surprise, then, that the introduction of self-driving cars on our streets is a highly contested issue today. While the technology embodies our problem-solving prowess, its practical application raises crucial questions that demand attention.

Self-driving cars have transitioned from science fiction to reality, with their development accelerating over the past seven years. Now, as we witness their functionality firsthand, it's imperative to weigh their pros and cons. One of the most compelling advantages is enhanced safety. An optimally designed autonomous vehicle inherently boasts a higher safety rating than human drivers, as it focuses solely on the road, unencumbered by distractions, intoxication, or daydreaming. Additionally, self-driving cars can revolutionize traffic patterns by coordinating across vehicles, maintaining consistent distances, and sharing road condition updates, potentially rendering rush hour obsolete and decreasing insurance and healthcare costs due to reduced accidents. These benefits span multiple sectors.

However, several critical concerns must be addressed before self-driving cars gain street legality. The legal and moral implications of an autonomous vehicle involved in an accident are profound, necessitating public discourse to reconcile the unavoidable harm caused by an unaccountable computer. This technology's widespread adoption may also erode our driving skills, introducing new societal challenges. Moreover, manufacturers must prioritize hacking concerns, given the existing vulnerability of high-tech vehicles to remote control breaches, which could jeopardize lives. Furthermore, unresolved technological hurdles include weather resilience and GPS accuracy, with adverse weather conditions and system blind spots posing significant risks.

Given the multifaceted nature of this issue, it's fortunate that fully functional autonomous vehicles are still in the development stage. While acknowledging the potential benefits, this writer also recognizes the extensive problems requiring resolution. Personally, the appeal of autonomous vehicles is overshadowed by the attachment to driving one's own car. The advent of self-driving cars might usher in an era where fleets of anonymous, unaccountable vehicles dominate the roads, displacing beloved classic cars. A prudent approach would be to reassess the technology in a decade, allowing for more comprehensive evaluation and refinement.@

**Improvement Summary:**

1. **Streamlined Introduction**: Enhanced flow and clarity.
2. **Rephrased Sentences**: Improved readability and concision.
3. **Emphasized Key Points**: Highlighted the main advantages and concerns.
4. **Added Transitions**: Smoothed the argument's flow between sections.
5. **Refined Conclusion**: Strengthened the final stance with a clearer call to action.
6. **Minor Edits**: Corrected grammatical errors and enhanced vocabulary for better clarity.","The forward march of technology has always been a source of controversy in society. Something as simple as the replacement of chalk and slate with pencil and paper in schoolhouses created public dialogue, so it is not hard to understand the great debate in our society today around something as monumental as self-driving cars taking the streets. The technology is exciting, exemplifying our problem solving capabilities and perseverance, but its application in our day to day lives presents many important questions that need to be answered first.

Self-driving cars have long been a staple of science fiction and our own personal dreams, but not seven years ago the idea of autonomous vehicles seemed far fetched. Now that we can see them functioning with our own eyes, we must question the pros and cons. There are some obvious benefits to self-driving cars, the first of which is safety. An ideally designed autonomous vehicle will  have a higher safety rating than any human driver simply because the computer only needs to focus on the road. They don't worried about kids, their days, or their hectic schedule like humans do, nor can they get drunk or daydream. Another thing to consider is the traffic patterns. Humans cannot coordinate across multiple vehicles, easily maintain a close, constant distance without causing worry, or communicate with other drivers about road conditions. A self-driving car would be able to do all of this and more! This would result in a better traffic experience for everyone. Rush hour might become a thing of the past, insurance and healthcare costs would decrease because of the reduced number of accidents. There are a plethora of benefits to self - driving cars across multiple fields.

However, there are some serious problems that need to addressed before self-driving cars become street legal. The legal and moral question of how to deal with a self-driving car that gets into an accident is heavy and complicated. ""Trolley problems"", blame assignment, legal debates, and a public discourse must take place so we as a society can reconcile the reality that someone will inevitably get hurt by a computer that cannot be held responsible for its actions. Over time, the prevalence of this technology might neuter our own driving skills, which would lead to a brand new set of issues for society. Also, hacking is a genuine concern manufacturers need to have for these products. There are already high end cars that rely on digital technology which have been hacked to give a remote user full control of a vehicle. If a hacker could gain control of an entire vehicle's operating system, lives could be in danger. This is all without even mentioning the serious technological problems that still need to be solved. Weather functionality and GPS accuracy are issues that still need working on. Thunderstorms and blizzards could cause serious problems for these vehicles, and self-driving cars are only as good as the system that guides them, which is a problem if that system goes blind every time it rains.

There are so many angles to this problem that its probably a good thing we are still far off from fully functional autonomous vehicles. This writer sees the potential benefits of self-driving cars, but also the vast problems that need to be dealt with before they become standard. I like my car. I like driving my car. I don't like the idea of something else driving my car for me. With the advent of self-driving cars, it might begin a wave that pushes our beloved classic cars off the roads to make way for fleets of autonomous vehicles with no identity, reliability, or accountability. I say wait a decade and see where the technology is then."
Self-driving cars,draft1_2018argrewrite_59.txt,"Self-driving cars seem to be on the horizon within the next several years. However, there is still a fierce debate to whether these cars will do more harm than good. Some believe that the development of these cars is the key for a successful future. Some people believe this because of how self-driving cars will reduce the likelihood of accidents as 81% of accidents are due to human error, make transportation more available for disabled people, and maximize efficiency as police/first responders can deal with other emergencies instead of auto-related incidents. While there are many people that support such cars, there are others that are dead against it. The main reasons why people are against self-driving cars include the difficulty of implementation and the many troubles and hassles that will arise after implementation.

        After a thorough analysis of the benefits and problems of self-driving cars, I believe that self-driving cars are more of a detriment to society than benefit. One reason that supports this idea is how expensive the cars will be to buy once they hit commercial production. A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car. With a projected average price of $100,000, the majority of Americans will not be able to afford these cars. Thus, the production of self-driving cars, no matter the benefits, will not help society if only the very wealthy are able to afford them.

Another reason why the problems with self-driving cars outweigh the benefits is the amount of disruption it will cause to society. With self-driving cars being made, such technology will be made for other types of transportation, such as trucks, buses, planes, and trains. This technology will ultimately render any human authority on such vehicles useless. This will put the millions of people in the transportation industry out of work. These people will suffer until they find a new job which is not a guarantee. If they do not find a new job, they may resort to crime. Thus, though self-driving cars do make the road safe and maximize efficiency, millions of people will lose their jobs, hurting the economy drastically and possibly increasing crime. 

The last reason for why the self-driving cars have more problems than benefits is due to the idea that self-driving cars can be hacked. With this idea a great possibility, the safety benefit of self-driving cars is compromised as mentioned by the Guardian. Hackers can hack the cars so that they will crash or drive off a bridge. With the main benefit of self-driving cars, safety, being so easy to be compromised, the whole idea of having self-driving cars can be thrown out.

To conclude, self-driving cars cause more problems than solutions to society. This is because they cost too much for the average person to buy, will put many people out of jobs, damaging the economy and increasing crime, and being susceptible to hacking.","

Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize the automotive industry within the next several years, yet the debate surrounding their potential impact remains intense. Proponents argue that these vehicles will significantly reduce accidents (81% of which are caused by human error), enhance transportation accessibility for the disabled, and optimize emergency response times. Conversely, opponents cite the challenges of implementation and post-launch complications. 

Following a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks, I firmly believe that self-driving cars will ultimately prove more detrimental to society than beneficial. Firstly, their exorbitant cost upon commercial release will render them inaccessible to the average American, with a projected average price of $100,000. The requisite expensive machinery will create a significant financial barrier, undermining the potential benefits for the broader population.

Furthermore, the widespread adoption of self-driving technology across various transportation modes (trucks, buses, planes, and trains) will inevitably displace millions of workers in the transportation sector. This disruption will lead to widespread unemployment, potentially driving individuals to crime, and severely impacting the economy. While enhanced road safety and efficiency are notable advantages, the devastating job losses and economic repercussions cannot be overlooked.

Additionally, the susceptibility of self-driving cars to hacking, as highlighted by The Guardian, severely compromises their primary safety benefit. The risk of vehicles being manipulated to crash or lose control undermines the fundamental rationale for their adoption.

In conclusion, self-driving cars pose more problems than solutions for society, primarily due to their prohibitively high cost, the catastrophic job losses and economic instability they will inflict, and their vulnerability to cyber threats. These significant drawbacks outweigh the potential benefits, warranting a more cautious approach to their development and implementation. "

**The Balance of Self-Driving Cars: Weighing the Pros and Cons**

**Advantages: Focused on Enhanced Safety and Efficiency**

1. **Error Reduction and Accident Prevention**: Human error, a leading cause of crashes, is significantly mitigated by the computer system in self-driving cars. This system continuously adjusts to obstacles and remains vigilant, eliminating distractions such as drunk driving and texting while driving, thereby saving lives.
2. **Economic Benefits**: The elimination of human error reduces insurance costs and the need for driver's education, cutting out middleman expenses associated with driving.
3. **Optimized Time Utilization**: Without the burden of driving, individuals can engage in other activities, and advancements in self-driving technology may lead to increased speed limits and more efficient navigation around road obstructions, reducing travel time.

**Disadvantages: Challenges and Concerns**

1. **Accessibility and Affordability**: Initially, self-driving cars are expected to be expensive, potentially out of reach for many Americans, and could disrupt the income of those reliant on ride-sharing services.
2. **Technological Vulnerabilities**: The reliance on computer systems introduces risks of software hacking, detection issues, and weather interference, which could lead to malfunctions.
3. **Liability Concerns**: Determining responsibility in the event of an accident poses a significant legal challenge.

**Personal Stance: Embracing the Future of Transportation**

Acknowledging my privileged position to potentially afford such technology, I firmly believe the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks. Key to my stance are:

- **Substantial Reduction in Human Error**: A crucial step in enhancing road safety, especially with the increasing number of vehicles on the road.
- **Valuable Time Optimization**: The potential to reclaim time spent driving for more productive or leisurely activities is invaluable in today's fast-paced world.

While addressing the concerns of affordability, technological reliability, and legal frameworks is paramount, the long-term advantages of self-driving cars in terms of safety, efficiency, and personal time management make them a preferable future for our world. ","In general, many of the pros center on preventing damage. Many crashes are caused by poor drivers and human error. Simply driving around any major city today would provide adequate proof of that. The computer system incorporated into self-driving cars would account for many errors that humans make. This computer system would adjust to obstacles and always be on guard. This would also include major distractions for human drivers including drunk driving and texting and driving. Self-driving cars also are likely to save lives. The same human error and distractions mentioned earlier will be taken out of the equation by the vehicle and computer. These cars would also cut out the middle man costs for a lot of driving in the form of insurance and drivers ed. Lastly, there are many factors that will help to allow people to take full advantage of the time that they have. Without the burden of driving, people can use that time to do other things. Also, increased speed limits and adaptations to road obstructions can get people to their destinations faster.

There are also many potential negatives, many of which seem to effect the lower class. Self-driving cars are bound to be expensive, and outside of the reach of many Americans. Additionally, many people rely on ride sharing services as their means of making money. Also, there is the fallibility of machines. There is always a chance of damage or malfunction inherent in any computer operated system. The software involved in the self-driving cars might be hacked, there may be detection issues, and weather may affect the detection. There is also the issue of responsibility in the case of an incident. Who is to blame in the event of an accident? A question like that will take a lot of time to work out.

With both sides of the issue being addressed, I will now give my personal stance on the issue. I am of the belief that self-driving cars are better for the world than they are worse. I want to start by acknowledging my privilege. I am on the trajectory to be in a financial situation to be able to afford a car like this. Especially if insurance costs are cut out, I see potentially being able to afford a self-driving car. More generally, I believe that cutting out human errors is extremely important. With more and more cars being on the road today, there is a higher and higher chance to of being in an accident as a result of human error. To eliminate that, or highly reduce the chances, would be a huge win. Secondly, having much more time would be a great thing. Like the saying goes, time is the one thing that you can never get back. To potentially take less time to get places, and to be able to use the time that you would usually be driving would be extremely helpful. Overall, I believe that these benefits greatly outweigh the costs."
