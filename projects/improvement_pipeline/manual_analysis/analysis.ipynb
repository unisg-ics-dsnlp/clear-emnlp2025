The prospect of cars that autonomously drive is an attractive one for a number of positive reasons. One argument for self-driving cars could be that they would reduce car accidents and therefore save lives. 81 percent of car crashes are the result of human error; therefore, it is appealing to think that computer systems specifically designed to combat the issues associated with human error could be good alternatives. By developing specific software algorithms to respond to a myriad of situations and scenarios, self-driving cars appear to have the capability to handle any situation a human driver might encounter. Because self-driving cars would be fully automated to respond to all situations, it is comforting to think that all actions made in response to situations would lead to the best possible outcomes.\n",
       "\tUnfortunately, we still have a way to go before these prospects and visions about self-driving cars can truly be attained. I would like to argue that we need to spend more time considering the legal and moral dilemmas presented by self-driving cars and their actions, and how these differ from the actions taken by typical human drivers. To exemplify a possible situation in which a legal and moral dilemma might arise, I would like to use a twist on the common ethical conundrum posed by the trolley problem. For our purposes, imagine you are sitting behind the wheel of your car and driving down the street. Seemingly out of nowhere, a ball rolls into the street, followed by a child chasing after it. In the moment in which you see the child, you must make a decision as to how you will react. Your two choices consist of either attempting to brake and hope that you stop in time to not injure the child, or swerving the car to the side of the road and risk hitting a tree, thus injuring yourself. As humans in this type of situation, we would be required to react nearly instantly, therefore it is difficult to fault someone for choosing either of these two options. However, because self-driving cars are programmed in advance, we must as a society decide what the best action would be for the car to take. Would the programmer who decides which action the car should take be held responsible if the car is unable to stop in time to prevent injuring the child? Or would the programmer be held responsible if the car swerves and injures the “driver” after hitting a tree? There does not seem to be an easy answer to these questions, however, if we are going to instruct self-driving cars to act in ways that produce the best outcomes, it is necessary for us to decide what this looks like and how it is manifested in various real-world examples.\n",
       "\tWith these questions in mind, it is important that we consider the legal and ethical dilemmas resulting from advances in self-driving car capabilities, before we are ready to implement them throughout our society.</td>\n",

       "Self-driving cars are poised to revolutionize transportation, following in the footsteps of transformative technologies like the internet and cell phones. Their appeal lies in various benefits, notably the potential to reduce car accidents and save lives. Since 81% of car crashes result from human error, computer systems designed to mitigate such errors seem like an attractive alternative. By utilizing sophisticated software algorithms, self-driving cars appear capable of handling complex situations. However, this automation also raises concerns about the uniformity of responses and their outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before we fully embrace self-driving cars, it's crucial to address the unresolved legal and moral dilemmas surrounding their actions, which diverge significantly from those of human drivers. A variation of the classic trolley problem illustrates this challenge: Imagine a child suddenly chasing a ball into the street. As a human driver, the instantaneous decision between braking (risking injury to the child) or swerving (risking self-injury by hitting a tree) is difficult to fault. In contrast, self-driving cars, being pre-programmed, necessitate societal consensus on the optimal response. If the car fails to stop and injures the child, or swerves and harms the \"driver,\" who bears responsibility—the programmer or someone else? These questions highlight the need for clear guidelines on what constitutes the \"best outcome\" in various scenarios.\n",

       "      <td id=\"T_3417e_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >There has been much discussion on the topic of self driving cars recently. Many people think that having self driving cars on the road would be a bad idea. They worry about things like liability in the case of accidents, and loss of jobs for truck drivers and others employed in the automotive industry. However, self driving cars are the way of the future. The pros of having self driving cars on the road vastly outweigh the cons. The effects of self driving cars will benefit society in a multitude of ways, and will allow mankind to advance further in technology and science alike.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are many ways that the advent of self driving cars will be beneficial to mankind. For example, many people get distracted while driving, which is one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents in the United States as of now. However, if a computer were to take control of the car, there would no distraction; the computer would stay completely focused on the road, effectively cutting the amount of accidents greatly. This has more implications than just saving human life, there would also be much more money saved as a result of this. Right now there is 9.2 million dollars saved for accidents on the road, less accidents would mean less of this money would have to be saved and could be used in other areas such as infrastructure. Additionally, many cars even have features that resemble early stages of self driving cars; most cars have sensors to detect objects, have autonomous breaking, and many other driver-less car like features. Making the step to fully autonomous cars is not actually as big as a jump as critics may believe. There are many benefits that self driving cars may have for society, and this op-ed only covers a fraction of how self driving cars have the potential to help humanity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even with all of the benefits that self driving cars have to offer, there are still some things that critics are worried about. For example, many people worry that people may not have the skills needed to operate cars, and if there was a glitch, this may turn into a serious issue. However, there could easily be regulations enacted that would require drivers to take a test every year or so, to ensure that they can take over in the case of an emergency. Another common concern is handing over the power of the car to a computer, which can malfunction with a small coding error. This is not a valid concern though, as each car would be thoroughly tested before consumer use, and furthermore, humans have even more capacity to 'malfunction' and cause an accident that computers do! Though people may have concerns about the effects of self driving cars on society, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will harm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Self driving cars is the subject of much scrutiny. There are many people with strong opinions for both sides. However, after reading this op-ed, I hope that I have convinced you of all of the benefits that self driving cars can bring, and I hope that you are now a supporter of the idea.</td>\n",

       "There is ongoing debate surrounding self-driving cars, with many expressing concerns about their integration into our roads. While worries about liability, job losses for truck drivers, and automotive industry workers are valid, the benefits of self-driving cars far outweigh these drawbacks. The widespread adoption of self-driving cars will have a profoundly positive impact on society, driving technological and scientific advancements.\n",
       "\n",
       "One significant advantage of self-driving cars is the drastic reduction in motor vehicle accidents, primarily caused by distracted driving in the United States. By relinquishing control to computers, which remain entirely focused on the road, the accident rate will plummet. This not only saves lives but also allocates the currently reserved $9.2 million for accident damages to other vital areas, such as infrastructure. Notably, many modern cars already feature precursory autonomous technologies, including object detection sensors and autonomous braking, making the transition to fully autonomous vehicles less daunting than critics suggest. This op-ed merely scratches the surface of the vast societal benefits self-driving cars can offer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these advantages, critics raise concerns about the potential loss of driving skills among the population, which could exacerbate issues in the event of a technical glitch. However, this can be mitigated through regular, mandatory driver proficiency tests. Another concern is the reliance on computers, which can malfunction due to coding errors. This worry is unfounded, as all consumer-bound vehicles will undergo rigorous testing, and notably, human error is a far more common cause of accidents than computer malfunction. While opinions on self-driving cars are divided, it is clear that their integration will yield more benefits than drawbacks.\n",

Owing to their platooning behaviour and complex algorithms to control the distance between two cars, it is believed that self-driving cars will reduce the occurrence of road accidents. Although self-driving cars offer so many advantages, there are numerous disadvantages as well. With the new self-driving technology, unemployment rates will rise, the gasoline industry will be hit. These cars are very expensive. There are high chances of technology failure and thus it is not guaranteed that self-driving cars will be safer.\n",

       "    In my opinion, self-driving cars, in general, will be not be so beneficial for society. The one reason why we would encourage this technology is that it will make the life of commuters very easy by reducing the commute time by reducing congestion, allowing them to do other important tasks while travelling, reducing their dependability on others or public transport, reducing efforts to learn driving, reducing the need for parking spaces, etc. \n",
       "\n",
       "    However, there are numerous reasons why we shouldn't. Self-driving cars work completely on computer technology, sensors and GPS tracking. In a situation when any one of these fails, there is a threat for a huge accident to occur. If the vehicle is moving at a high speed and the sensors are not able to detect an obstacle very near to the vehicle it will be an accident. Most of the times, GPS is not very accurate. For example, in a city named Pittsburgh, there are numerous GPS trackers on staircases which are detected and recommended as the shortest route. You cannot avoid these unless the computer knows about the presence of such pseudo roads. All such instances will lead to an accident.\n",

Self-driving cars appear to suffer in circumstances that significantly deviate from programmed conditions, such as lack of GPS information to guide the road or extreme weather conditions that prevent visualization of the road. However, it is important to point out that these are limitations. These factors should not stop and abandon the progress that has been made in this technology. \n",
       "Self-driving cars can become advantageous. While glitch in a self-driving system is dangerous and risks driver's life, this problem is inherent in any automobiles, even those that are not self-driving. Several renowned automobile companies like GM, Volkswagen and Audi issued major recall because of brake problems, which put numerous drivers at life threatening danger. For self-driving cars, if the problem can be quickly addressed by software update, without having to recall all the automobiles. This can not only save money and resource from the automobile company but also time and inconvenience that a driver has to experience. Additionally, self-driving cars can save lives. Countless number of car accidents arise from distractions ranging from Coors Light to Instagram. Self-driving cars can free drivers from these distractions, providing safe conditions for both drivers and pedestrians. Furthermore, as any technological advances have proved in the past, self-driving technology is a utility that will save time from mundane and expendable daily activity. It can boost productivity in individuals because they can put time that was spent on driving on alternative activity. Likewise, self-driving cars can reduce costs commonly associated with automobile nowadays. Self-driving cars are automated. They are less likely to suffer from individual variability of drivers and can reduce common outcomes resulting from these individual differences, such as heavy traffic and sparse parking space. Due to its programmed function, self-driving cars can make driving during rush hour less painful or even non-existent. \n",

However, some people may argue that self-driving cars are not perfect enough, especially in terms of driving in severe weather conditions. As many people know, some car accidents happen to be during the severe weather conditions.  \n",
       "       Another advantage of driverless cars is saving some money. Getting a driverless car means that the owner will pay less for the car insurance, or even not to have one, and save money on gasoline, because self-driving cars are run by electricity. On the other hand, the latter helps us retain a sustainable environment. However, there are still some people that might argue instead of saving money, the owners of those fancy cars might end by paying more, for the short-term. Because self-driving cars will cost approximately $100 000 on average. However, in the far future, that number might decrease as the competition rate among car manufacturing companies rises. \n",
       "       The last but not least benefit of getting a driverless car is saving time. Time is money, is not it? There will be no need to take driving courses, going through the process of plenty of examinations to get the driver's license and so on. Even for this advantage, we will find a group of people which might argue by saying owners still need to spend some time to comprehend new information, especially in terms of pressing the button on the car. If we compare those two time series, the former will happen to be the most time and energy consuming sets of activities. \n",

With their being around 33,000 fatalities on the road every year, that's about 27,000 lives being saved every year, as self driving technology basically ends error on the part of the driver. Most accidents occur due to distracted or impaired driving, which is impossible for a computer as they can not take their eyes of the road and, thankfully, can not get drunk. Another positive is that the decrease in overall accidents on the road give police more time to focus on other situations. They also do not have to constantly be giving tickets as cars can drop off their passengers and park themselves wherever is convenient, and come back whenever they need picked up again. Also with the people in the vehicle not having to do anything, they have more time to work on other things. The cars also work together and relay traffic information, which decreases traffic and allows them to get to their location faster, which also adds to the passengers time. All this time saved can lead to a even more productive society where everyone can do more and can get anywhere promptly without having to worry about traffic.\n",
       "As with all new inventions, skeptics have come about spouting the negatives of the self driving car technology, but most of it can be solved with more testing and more support. They say that self driving cars can be hacked and that they are not as effective in violent weather, but these are just the problems with new technology. These problems will be accounted for and worked on over time, eventually becoming less and less of an issue. Another problem people bring up is cost, as it is expensive for someone to buy one as of today. As time goes on, the cost would go down as with any new product due to advancements and scaling of the industry, but even if it was still to expensive for people, since the cars can drive and park themselves, there could be the advent of an Uber or Lyft type service where individuals can have these cars pick them up and take them wherever they need to go, which could eliminate even the need to own a car. A final point they bring up is that it will hurt many industries, such as the gasoline and driving instructor industry. With this point I ask, should we not have invented cars as to keep horseshoe makers in business? Of course not, as we should not halt progress and overall good for the many rather than just focusing on the needs of a select few individuals.\n",
       "Overall, self driving cars should be considered an positive step for the advancement of society. Most of the problems with them will be solved over time, and the pros for the implementation of it are staggering. I think they will be implemented soon, and I can't wait for them to arrive.</td>\n",

One huge dilemma that society faces today is how to make driving increasingly efficient and roadways much safer than their current state. Recently, technology has advanced enough to bring about a potential solution: the self-driving car. Although, there is an abundance of evident positives if the self-driving car were to work properly, many are still concerned that this new piece of technology will not solve today's automobile problems with the possibility to bring rise to other issues. Those for self-driving cars associate most of their claims with the fact that the car will create a safer driving environment while those against it seek reason to believe that accidents are not completely eliminated. However, the invention of self-driving cars clearly depicts a widened ability and benefit to each and every community that implements this new technology. The utilization of self-driving cars does not only provide positives that outweigh potential negatives, it also allows society to continue to progress and prosper in an extraordinary way. \n",
       "\tOne huge benefit resulting from the introduction of self-driving cars would be the dramatic improvement on roadways regarding traffic conditions. Through the use of this technology, drivers will feel much safer on the roadways while also having a much more efficient commute. Noticeable improvements that would occur include having reduced commute times and limited traffic incidences. \"According to Eno Transportation, self-driving cars…would significantly improve traffic conditions and congestion. This would help to reduce commute times…also to maximize on gasoline usage…driving time could be reduced by faster speeds allowed on the road\" (\"Self-Driving Cars\", par. 18, 22). By increasing the speed limits on roadways, gasoline is used in a further appropriate manner than it is already while, consequently, allowing people to reach their destinations quicker. This, in part, contributes to the reduction of the amount of traffic seen on major highways - something of which is a major factor in automobile accidents. Self-driving cars will also have technology that provides the ability for the car to detect distance between itself and other cars. \"Sensors in the autonomous cars allow vehicles to ride closer together, therefore allowing more cars on the road with actually less traffic\" (par. 28). With this, cars will be able to ride together at a much closer distance, optimizing time and space to decrease traffic problems.\n",
       "\tAlthough, it appears that self-driving cars are unmistakably beneficial to society, controversy is still held upon the idea of implementing them. A highly observed criticism of self-driving cars would be that car accidents are not completely eliminated on roadways. \"A self-driving car doesn't completely eliminate the likelihood of a car accident…many individuals are nervous about handing over all the power to a computer, which could malfunction and put the danger in a more dangerous situation\" (par. 39, 44). Many uphold their position that using self-driving cars could propose a gigantic threat for those driving for car accidents are still likely, yet the drivers will feel incompetent to handle these types of situations. Yet, what these critics fail to realize is the fact that technology employed in these vehicles has been tested and altered at the sight of the most minute malfunctions. In order to be successful, these companies will not release a device that is not beyond exceptional to the public. Of course, there will be a percentage of problems that will occur, however, this percentage is so small due to there being no possible way to account for these situations - everything proposes the risk of harm, despite its efforts to reduce it. \n",
       "\tThe technology used within these self-driving cars is surpasses current technology today in the sense that it calls for superior behaviors and actions on the road to reduce accidents. Since there are various algorithms within the coding of the car, the vehicle gains the ability to process external information like never before to enhance driving. \"Computers use complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically\" (par. 13). Through the utilization of such algorithms, it drastically decreases the possibility of accidents to almost nothing for the code is perfected to the point of flawlessness. In direct result of this, traffic problems will not only be reduced but identified in the chance that one does occur. \"In order for the cars to operate most efficiently, they'd need to communicate with one another, helping to identify traffic problems or road risks early on\" (par. 19). Since nothing can be completely eliminated, algorithms will also account for detection and early recognition to minimize the amount of traffic and problems on the road. Through communication between self-driving cars, an individual vehicle will be able to discover potential threats and change route earlier enough - something that current drivers are unable until it is too late. \n",

Even though there appears to have some problems to come out of self-driving cars, the positives clearly outweigh the negatives for driving overall will be safer and more efficient.

This has the potential to make roadways more efficient and commute shorter. One of the most attractive aspects of a self-driving car is the convenience that they provide. The New York Times has suggested that these cars would be a great asset to individuals with disabilities; instead of relying on public transportation they would be able to operate their car as anyone else would. These cars would also be an asset to an individual who wants to get work done in the time it takes to make their commute; they could safely work on a laptop or hold a conversation without having to worry about driving. \n",
       "  At this point you're thinking, 'this seems great, sign me up!', right? Well, you might want to re-consider. Self-driving cars sound great in theory but thinking through their practical applications one runs into several road blocks (pun intended). Consider this. A person gets into their car while intoxicated. In theory, this wouldn't be a problem because the car can simply drive itself and the individual can safely ride in the back without endangering themself or others. The car comes upon a traffic signal that is not operating correctly and there is a traffic cop directly the flow of cars. The self-driving car is not equipped to deal with human signals; it does not have human judgement. Instead of being able to over-ride the autonomic function of the car the individual is incapacitated themself and so the car speeds through the signal resulting in an accident where several people are injured.

Roughly 81% of car crashes are due to human error, and 33,000 traffic related deaths are more than likely preventable yearly. At least one of these options directly relates to each, and every person in a given community. Many issues that plague individuals revolve around transportation. From having to wake up earlier in the day because of an increased workload to compensate for traffic, to getting a call that a loved one was in an accident. The increased amount of self-driving vehicles being adopted by consumers will have a positive correlation with the daily lives of those that do not own them.\n",

By way of safer roads through self-driving vehicles being more prevalent, because of factors such as the reduction of human error through computers doing the driving, the amount of money being spent by insurance companies will drive down insurance premiums so they can remain competitive. As these vehicles become more common on the roads the cost to purchase them will go down. As it currently sits seven different agencies have taken steps to begin the development of self driving vehicles. Companies will find ways to lower costs through more efficient methods of production, and distribution as industry competitiveness increases. The savings of money is then passed down to local, and state governments because of less money being spent on methods of mass transit. Crumbling, or nonexistent, local infrastructures will gain a sense of relief from the self driving car industry from the lower amount of people utilizing the systems. City buses, and train maintenance costs will plummet, and those savings are then passed down to the tax paying citizens of the said cities, and states.\n",

The plentiful amount of vehicles which will transport its occupants will decrease the need for public transportation, and taxi services. This will happen through the constant adoption, evolution, and efficiency of self driving vehicles. These types of vehicles communicate with one another through a method called platooning. In the midst of their communication they will be able to identify traffic patterns, and alternate routes to their destination. This adaptation is something that public transit employees are not able to do because of specified routes that they must take. Though there may be a reduction in those fields of employment other opportunities will undoubtedly be created. An increased need for engineers, auto mechanics, road repairmen/women, and salespeople will have a profound impact on economies.\n",

The prospect of cars that autonomously drive is an attractive one for a number of positive reasons. One argument for self-driving cars could be that they would reduce car accidents and therefore save lives. 81 percent of car crashes are the result of human error; therefore, it is appealing to think that computer systems specifically designed to combat the issues associated with human error could be good alternatives. By developing specific software algorithms to respond to a myriad of situations and scenarios, self-driving cars appear to have the capability to handle any situation a human driver might encounter. Because self-driving cars would be fully automated to respond to all situations, it is comforting to think that all actions made in response to situations would lead to the best possible outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unfortunately, we still have a way to go before these prospects and visions about self-driving cars can truly be attained. We need to spend more time considering the legal and moral dilemmas presented by self-driving cars and their actions, and how these differ from the actions taken by typical human drivers. To exemplify a possible situation in which a legal and moral dilemma might arise, I will present an ethical conundrum. Imagine you are sitting behind the wheel of your car, driving down the street. Seemingly out of nowhere, a ball rolls into the street, followed by a child chasing after it. You must make a decision as to how you will react. Your two choices consist of either attempting to brake and hope that you stop in time to not injure the child, or swerving the car to the side of the road and risk hitting a tree, thus injuring yourself. As humans in this type of situation, we would be required to react nearly instantly, therefore it is difficult to fault someone for choosing either of these two options. However, because self-driving cars are programmed in advance, we must, as a society, decide what the best action would be for the car to take. Would the programmer who decides which action the car should take be held responsible if the car is unable to stop in time to prevent injuring the child? Or would the programmer be held responsible if the car swerves and injures the \"driver\" after hitting a tree? There does not seem to be an easy answer to these questions, however, if we are going to instruct self-driving cars to act in ways that produce the best outcomes, it is necessary for us to decide what this looks like and how it is manifested in various real-world examples.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a response to quell these fears, one could argue that self-driving cars could be equipped with video monitoring devices to help ensure adequate driving performance. Rather than being forced to rely on humans’ memory of an accident (as in the scenario above), society would be able to study the video footage to see the causes and responses that resulted in the accident. In a similar manner, this footage could then be used to better program the software in order to make self-driving cars safer for pedestrians, and also the humans sitting behind the wheel of the car.\n",

By leveraging sophisticated algorithms to respond to a wide range of scenarios, self-driving cars appear capable of handling any situation a human driver might encounter, always opting for the best possible outcome.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, before these visions become a reality, we must address the significant legal and moral dilemmas self-driving cars present, particularly in how their actions differ from those of human drivers. A poignant ethical conundrum arises in scenarios requiring immediate, life-altering decisions. For instance, imagine a child suddenly chasing a ball into the street. A human driver must choose between braking, risking injury to the child, or swerving, endangering themselves. Given the instantaneous nature of such decisions, it's challenging to fault either choice. In contrast, self-driving cars, being pre-programmed, necessitate a societal consensus on the optimal action. Should the programmer be held accountable if the car fails to stop in time, or if it swerves and injures the occupant? These questions highlight the complexity of defining \"best outcomes\" for self-driving cars in real-world scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "To alleviate such concerns, equipping self-driving cars with video monitoring devices could ensure transparent driving performance. Unlike relying on human recollections of accidents, video footage would provide clear insights into causes and responses, facilitating the improvement of software to enhance safety for both pedestrians and vehicle occupants.\n",

Many people think that having self driving cars on the road would be a bad idea. They worry about things such as liability in case of accidents, and loss of jobs for truck drivers and others employed in the automotive industry. However, self driving cars are the way of the future. The pros of having self driving cars on the road vastly outweigh the cons. The effects of self driving cars will benefit society in a multitude of ways, and will allow mankind to advance further in technology and science alike.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are many ways that the advent of self driving cars will be beneficial to mankind. For example, many people get distracted while driving (by talking with friends, on the phone, or even seeing something interesting on the roadside), which is one of the leading causes of motor vehicle accidents in the United States as of now. However, it is not possible for a computer to become distracted, it does not have personality or curiosity like humans do; thus if computers controlled the wheel, this would greatly reduce accidents on the road. This has more implications than just saving human life, there would also be much money saved as a result. Right now there is 9.2 million dollars saved for motor vehicle accidents, less accidents would mean less of this money would have to be saved and could be allocated to other poorly funded areas. Additionally, many cars even have features that resemble early stages of self driving cars; most cars have object sensors, autonomous breaking, and many other driver-less car like features. Consequently, the step to fully autonomous cars is not actually as big as critics may believe. There are many benefits that self driving cars may have for society, and this op-ed only covers a fraction of how self driving cars have the potential to help humanity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even with all of the benefits that self driving cars have to offer, there are still some things that critics are worried about. For example, many people worry that people may not have the skills needed to operate cars, and if there was a glitch, this may turn into a serious issue. However, there could easily be regulations enacted that would require drivers to take a test every year or so, to ensure that they can take over in the case of an emergency. Just as drivers have to prove they can drive a car today, they would have to do the same in the future. Another common concern is handing over the power of the car to a computer, which can malfunction with only a small coding error. This is not a valid concern though, as each car would be thoroughly tested before consumer use. Furthermore, humans have even more capacity to 'malfunction' and cause an accident that computers do! Though people may have concerns about the effects of self driving cars on society, they will ultimately accomplish more good than they will harm.\n",

       "Self-driving cars offer a lot of freedom to the drivers to do other tasks while commuting. Drunk-driving will be a past. Disabled people will not have to depend on anyone else to commute. Owing to their platooning behaviour and complex algorithms to control the distance between two cars, it is believed that self-driving cars will reduce the occurrence of road accidents. Although self-driving cars offer so many advantages, there are numerous disadvantages as well. With the new self-driving technology, unemployment rates will rise, the gasoline industry will be hit. These cars are very expensive. There are high chances of technology failure and thus it is not guaranteed that self-driving cars will be safer.\n",

Although there are some reasons why we would encourage this technology like making the life of commuters very easy by reducing the commute time, allowing them to do other important tasks while travelling, reducing their dependability on others or public transport, reducing efforts to learn driving, reducing the need for parking spaces, etc. There are numerous reasons why we shouldn't. \n",
       "\n",
       "One main reason that makes self-driving cars unsafe is the unforeseen failure of technology. Self-driving cars work completely on computer technology, sensors and GPS tracking. In a situation of technical failure, there is a high risk for accidents to occur. Technical failure includes but not limited to the sensors not functioning or no internet connectivity etc. Non-functioning sensors will not signal the car to stop in the presence of an obstacle. This might lead to a huge accident especially when the car is at a high speed.\n",
       "Also, the GPS is not always accurate. For example, in a city named Pittsburgh, there are numerous GPS trackers on staircases which are detected as the shortest route. If your car follows the shortest path shown by GPS, it might lead to an accident. Unless the computer knows about the presence of such pseudo roads, you will not be able to avoid this situation. Thus we can see that with all such instances, self-driven cars are not as safe as they are expected to be.\n",

Several renowned automobile companies like GM, Volkswagen and Audi issued major recall throughout the country due to manufacture problems. These mistakes are fetal, putting numerous drivers at life threatening danger. Problems associated with self-driving cars become evident under circumstances that significantly deviate from typical and average conditions that a driver encounters in a day-to-day life. Examples of these circumstances can be lack of GPS information to provide proper navigation route or extreme weather conditions that prevent visualization of the road.

       "Self-driving cars can offer greater advantages that can make our lives more convenient and safer. First, problems in self-driving cars can be quickly addressed by software update. This gets rid of the costs and time associated with massive recall of automobiles. This can benefit both automobile company and drivers. Second, self-driving cars can be safer than drivers. Countless number of car accidents arise from distracted drivers. Nowadays, drivers face countless distractors, ranging from drinking to social media. Self-driving cars can free drivers from these factors, providing safe conditions for both drivers and pedestrians. Third, self-driving technology is a utility that will save time from mundane and expendable daily activity. As shown in the past, any technological advances like washer and dryer can reduce significant amount of time devoted to the labor. As for a self-driving car, it can boost productivity in individuals because they can put time that was spent on driving on alternative activity. Lastly, self-driving cars can reduce costs commonly associated with automobile nowadays. Self-driving cars are automated. They are less likely to suffer from individual variability of drivers and can reduce common outcomes resulting from these differences, such as heavy traffic and sparse parking space. Due to its programmed function, self-driving cars can make driving during rush hour less painful or even non-existent.\n",
       "As suggested, self-driving technology offers powerful advantages. Once self-driving technology becomes more mature and developed, this can greatly enhance everyday life of both drivers and non-drivers, reliving burdens arising from heavy traffics and accidents, and most importantly saving lives. Even though some may argue that this technology will make driver's education obsolete, if it makes drinking and driving education and its appalling videos around prom season obsolete, it might worth the transition to self-driving cars.</td>\n",

       "What have industry giants like Google, Tesla, and Uber invested heavily in over recent years? Self-driving cars. \n",
       "Although these vehicles have garnered significant attention, their technology appears premature for widespread adoption, as evidenced by recent high-profile self-driving car crashes, prompting Uber to suspend its self-driving service. However, it's essential to acknowledge that system glitches posing life-threatening risks are inherent in all automobiles, as exemplified by the numerous recalls issued by GM, Volkswagen, and Audi due to manufacturing defects. \n",
       "\n",
       "Notably, self-driving car malfunctions often occur under extraordinary circumstances that deviate from typical daily driving conditions, such as GPS signal loss or extreme weather impairing road visibility. While these are technical limitations, they shouldn't halt progress in this field.\n",
       "\n",
       "Self-driving cars offer substantial advantages that can enhance convenience and safety in our lives. Firstly, software updates can swiftly address issues, eliminating the costs and time associated with mass vehicle recalls, benefiting both manufacturers and drivers. Secondly, self-driving cars are safer, as they're immune to distractions (e.g., drinking, social media) that contribute to countless accidents. This ensures a safer environment for both drivers and pedestrians. \n",
       "\n",
       "Thirdly, self-driving technology can save time previously spent on mundane daily activities, much like the washer and dryer have in the past. By automating driving, individuals can redirect this time to more productive pursuits. Lastly, self-driving cars can reduce costs associated with driving, such as those resulting from individual driver variability (e.g., heavy traffic, parking challenges), as their programmed functions can mitigate these issues, making rush-hour driving more efficient.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, self-driving technology offers compelling benefits. As it matures, it can significantly enhance the daily lives of both drivers and non-drivers, alleviating the burdens of heavy traffic and accidents, and most importantly, saving lives. While some may argue this technology could render driver's education obsolete, if it also makes drunk driving education (and its associated promotional campaigns) a thing of the past, the transition to self-driving cars may well be worthwhile.@</td>\n",

It is not easy to answer for this question. Before making any judgments, it is wise to brainstorm some arguable advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars.\n",
       "\n",
       "The main advantage of developing this new technological development is to reduce car accidents. There is no shadow of a doubt the main cause of road accident is the mistake made by a driver. This must have been the motivation behind creating driverless cars. Reducing the car accidents would help us save millions of lives and dollars. However, some people may argue that self-driving cars are not perfect enough, especially in case of driving in severe weather conditions. As many people know, some car accidents happen to be during those kind of weather conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another advantage of driverless cars is saving some money and here are two reasons why. First, getting a driverless car means that the owner will pay less for the car insurance, or not even have one. Second, it would help drivers to save some money on gasoline because self-driving cars are run by electricity. Moreover, the latter helps us retain a sustainable environment. However, there are still some people that might argue with the aforementioned advantage. Instead of saving money, the owners of those fancy cars might end by paying more because self-driving cars will cost approximately $100 000 on average. However, in the far future, that cost might decrease as the competition rate among car manufacturing companies rises.\n",
       "\n",
       "The last but not least benefit of getting a driverless car is saving some time. Time is money, is not it? There will be no need to take driving courses, going through the process of plenty of examinations and so on. Even for this advantage, we will find a group of people which might argue by saying that the owners still need to spend some time on comprehending new information. If we compare those two time series, the former will happen to be the most time and energy consuming sets of activities.\n",

       "Overall, it is clear that the advantages of developing self-driving cars outweigh the disadvantages. Whenever a new technological development knocks on our door, there will be a group of people who will open the door with the smile on their faces, another group of the people who will hesitate to open but still want to know what that is, and the third crowd who will shut the door before hearing a knock. So, I would say that it is good to be a part of the first and the second groups of people.</td>\n",

       "Two significant advantages of driverless cars are cost savings and environmental sustainability. Firstly, owners may pay less for car insurance or even forego it altogether. Secondly, electric-powered self-driving cars can lead to gasoline savings and contribute to a more sustainable environment. While some counter that the initial cost of these cars (approximately $100,000 on average) might outweigh the savings, increasing competition among manufacturers is likely to drive prices down in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Time Efficiency**\n",
       "Lastly, driverless cars offer a significant time-saving benefit. The need for driving courses and multiple examinations is eliminated, saving both time and energy.

       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "In conclusion, the benefits of developing self-driving cars clearly outweigh the drawbacks. When faced with new technology, people typically react in one of three ways: enthusiastic adoption, cautious curiosity, or outright rejection. Embracing the spirit of the first two groups is key to harnessing the potential of driverless cars. By acknowledging both the advantages and the challenges, we can work towards a safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation future. @</td>\n",

Self driving technology basically ends error on the part of the driver. Most accidents occur due to distracted or impaired driving. It is impossible for a computer to take its eyes off the road and, thankfully, it cannot get drunk either. This decrease in overall accidents on the road gives police more time to focus on other situations. Additionally, the passengers do not have to do any work to drive the car. This allows the cars to drop off and pick up their passengers and it also provides passengers with more time complete other tasks. Passengers also receive more time for themselves since the cars can work together to relay traffic information, which decreases traffic and allows them to get to their location faster. This saved time can lead to an even more productive society where everyone can do more and get around more quickly.\n",

These problems will be accounted for and worked on over time, eventually becoming less and less of an issue. Another problem people bring up is cost, as it is expensive for someone to buy one as of today. As time goes on, the cost would go down as with any new product due to advancements and scaling of the industry, but even if it was still to expensive for people, since the cars can drive and park themselves, there could be the advent of an Uber or Lyft type service where individuals can have these cars pick them up and take them wherever they need to go, which could eliminate even the need to own a car. A final point that skeptics bring up is that it will hurt many industries, such as the gasoline and driving instructor industry.

One huge dilemma that society faces today is how to make driving increasingly efficient and roadways much safer than their current state. Recently, technology has advanced enough to bring about a potential solution: the self-driving car. Although, there is an abundance of evident positives if the self-driving car were to work properly, many are still concerned that this new piece of technology will not solve today's automobile problems with the possibility to bring rise to other issues. Those for self-driving cars associate most of their claims with the fact that the car will create a safer driving environment while those against it seek reason to believe that accidents are not completely eliminated. However, the invention of self-driving cars clearly depicts a widened ability and benefit to each and every community that implements this new technology. The utilization of self-driving cars provides many positives that outweigh potential negatives, and the innovative technology allows society to continue to progress and prosper in an extraordinary way. \n",
       "\tOne huge benefit resulting from the introduction of self-driving cars would be the dramatic improvement on roadways regarding traffic conditions. Through the use of this technology, drivers will feel much safer on the roadways while also having a much more efficient commute. Noticeable improvements that would occur include having reduced commute times and limited traffic incidences. \"According to Eno Transportation, self-driving cars…would significantly improve traffic conditions and congestion. This would help to reduce commute times…also to maximize on gasoline usage…driving time could be reduced by faster speeds allowed on the road\" (\"Self-Driving Cars\", par. 18, 22). By increasing the speed limits on roadways, gasoline is used in a further appropriate manner than it is already while, consequently, allowing people to reach their destinations quicker. This, in part, contributes to the reduction of the amount of traffic seen on major highways - something of which is a major factor in automobile accidents. Another improvement of traffic conditions stems from self-driving cars having technology that provides the ability for the car to detect distance between itself and other cars. \"Sensors in the autonomous cars allow vehicles to ride closer together, therefore allowing more cars on the road with actually less traffic\" (par. 28). With this, cars will be able to ride together at a much closer distance, optimizing time and space to decrease traffic problems.\n",
       "\tAlthough, it appears that self-driving cars are unmistakably beneficial to society, controversy is still held upon the idea of implementing them. A highly observed criticism of self-driving cars would be that car accidents are not completely eliminated on roadways. \"A self-driving car doesn't completely eliminate the likelihood of a car accident…many individuals are nervous about handing over all the power to a computer, which could malfunction and put the danger in a more dangerous situation\" (par. 39, 44). Many uphold their position that using self-driving cars could propose a gigantic threat for those driving for car accidents are still likely, yet the drivers will feel incompetent to handle these types of situations. Though, what these critics fail to realize is the fact that technology employed in these vehicles has been tested and altered at the sight of the most minute malfunctions. In order to be successful, these companies will not release a device that is not beyond exceptional to the public. Of course, there will be a percentage of problems that will occur, however, this percentage is so small due to there being no possible way to account for these situations - everything proposes the risk of harm, despite its efforts to reduce it. \n",
       "\tThe technology used within these self-driving cars surpasses current technology today in the sense that it calls for superior behaviors and actions on the road to reduce accidents. Since there are various algorithms within the coding of the car, the vehicle gains the ability to process external information like never before to enhance driving which, in turn, leads to fewer accidents on the road. \"Computers use complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and other data that decreases the chances of car accidents dramatically\" (par. 13). Through the utilization of such algorithms, it drastically decreases the possibility of accidents to almost nothing for the code is perfected to the point of flawlessness. In direct result of this, traffic problems will not only be reduced but identified in the chance that one does occur. \"In order for the cars to operate most efficiently, they'd need to communicate with one another, helping to identify traffic problems or road risks early on\" (par. 19). Since the chance of car accidents cannot be completely eliminated, algorithms will also account for detection and early recognition to minimize the amount of traffic and problems on the road. Through communication between self-driving cars, an individual vehicle will be able to discover potential threats and change route earlier enough - something that current drivers are unable to do until it is too late. \n",

Google is one company that continuously strives to answer that call. Recently they have been doing so by researching the technology for and creating self-driving cars. While this may sound like some futuristic fabrication from Back to the Future, the technology is actually here and being tested even as this piece is being written. This new technology is exciting and has the potential to improve how we travel. It also comes with some serious drawbacks that must be considered before self-driving cars become utilized at a high rate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Self-driving cars would drastically change our mobility. Human error accounts for about 81 percent of car accidents; if everyone were to transition to self-drivings cars, human error would be eliminated and accidents would be projected to drastically decrease. Traffic patterns themselves would change. The technology in the car would be able to detect its proximity to other cars and adjust its speed and positioning accordingly. This has the potential to make roadways more efficient and commute shorter. One of the most attractive aspects of a self-driving car is the convenience that they provide. The New York Times has suggested that these cars would be a great asset to individuals with disabilities; instead of relying on public transportation they would be able to operate their car as anyone else would. These cars would also be an asset to an individual who wants to get work done in the time it takes to make their commute; they could safely work on a laptop or hold a conversation without having to worry about driving.\n",
       "\n",
       "At this point you're thinking, 'this seems great, sign me up!', right? Well, you might want to re-consider. Self-driving cars sound great in theory but thinking through their practical applications one runs into several road blocks (pun intended). Consider this. A person gets into their car while intoxicated. In theory, this wouldn't be a problem because the car can simply drive itself and the individual can safely ride in the back without endangering themself or others. The car comes upon a traffic signal that is not operating correctly and there is a traffic cop directly the flow of cars. The self-driving car is not equipped to deal with human signals; it does not have human judgement. Instead of being able to over-ride the autonomic function of the car the individual is incapacitated themself and so the car speeds through the signal resulting in an accident where several people are injured. Whose fault is this? The intoxicated individual? The car? The other cars involved? The answer is not clear cut here but the result is the same as if an intoxicated individual had chosen to manually drive the car.\n",
       "\n",
       "Humans are not perfect. But then again, neither is technology. Both may have the ability to drive a car but is one really better than the other? My response would be no. A self-driving car is an amazing feat of technology. It is a tool that can be used for many positive purposes and has the potential to change the way in which humans travel. But self-driving cars should only be that: a tool. The technology that drives these cars has the ability to fail such as in the scenario I described above, through security breaches, or through simple glitches. Humans should still retain the capacity to manually drive a car should the technology glitch and fail for both their safety and the safety of others.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thankfully, we have time to carefully think through all sides of the self-driving car conversation before they are able to be mass produced. At the current moment the price of the cars are astronomically high: around $100,000! With only the one percent being able to afford them we don't have to worry too much about how these cars will change our current transportation system. However, the sooner these topics are broached the easier it will be to resolve potential problems that arise regarding these cars in the future.</td>\n",

       "Self-Driving cars can decrease the percentage of car crashes. According to the U.S.  Department  of  Transportation, the cost of every human life is estimated to be valued at  $9,000,200.00. The advantage of having self-driving cars on the road will  result into a major cost savings in the following areas: Insurance costs and healthcare costs associated with accident recovery alone. Self-driving cars can allow the driver to complete other tasks while driving in the meantime. This will cause the driver not to worry about two things at one time. Self-driving cars can improve traffic conditions and eliminate traffic congestion. Consequently, commute times for drivers in high traffic areas will be decreased and there would be less wasting on gasoline. Self-driving cars can result into larger cities finally being able to provide better transportation to their residents. Taxes would be decreased because there would not be a need for drivers licenses to be issued. \n",
       "\t  Some disadvantages of having self-driving cars on the road are as followed:\n",
       "Self-driving cars on the road is that self-driving cars will not be affordable to people who are low income. Without everyone adapting to self-driving cars there will be a loss of lives, time, and costs. As a result of self-driving there will be a significant number of  lost jobs in the transplantation sector especially in the areas of freight transportation and taxi drivers. Self-driving cars can cause  a negative impact on the unemployment rate and also cause a negative impact on the economy. A tremendous amount of rain, can result into serious damage to the laser sensor mounted on the roof of all self driving cars. Driver's may lose the skill to operate vehicles because self-driving cars basically operate their selves. This can result into humans having a lack of knowledge in regards to operating a vehicle which can result into someone becoming an inexperience driver. Self-driving cars can impact a driver when he/she attempts to operate a boat or motorcycle. Basically self-driving cars can cause an experienced vehicle operator to become rusty, so to speak. \n",
       "\tThis article about self-driving cars caused me to become a strong believer that having self-driving on the road in today's society are more of an advantage than a disadvantage. After completely reading the article, I have gained a better understanding for self-driving cars, than I had prior to reading the article. I am definitely on the side of having self-driving cars. \n",
       "        I will now construct an argument that is in support of self-driving cars as beneficial to society. From the day self-driving cars arrived on the market they have gained a lot better mechanics, accuracy, and algorithm. Back in 2008, ten years ago, if I was asked to choose a side of  having self-driving cars on the road, I simply could not make a decision. People need to remember that autonomous vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives a year. In 2015, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company said research indicated self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by 90% once fully deployed. According to released stats from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 37,000 people died from motor vehicle crashes in 2016, making it a leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, self-driving cars are the best solution to decrease motor vehicle deaths in today's society. Self-driving cars can decrease police activity, which will result into there being less traffic stops. Having police conduct less traffic stops are one of the greatest advantages of having self-driving cars on the roads. In today's society, simple traffic laws which driver's failed to follow, many times had resulted into the driver being in a serious confrontation with law enforcement. It is all too clear that a simple traffic violation can turn into police brutality, a police shooting, or an unwarranted arrest for an entirely separate violation of the law. \n",

       "\n",
       "* **Enhanced Road Safety**: Self-driving cars can significantly decrease the percentage of car crashes. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, with the value of every human life estimated at $9,000,200.00, this translates to substantial cost savings in insurance and healthcare associated with accident recovery.\n",
       "* **Increased Productivity**: With the ability to complete other tasks while driving, individuals can multitask without the worry of divided attention.\n",
       "* **Improved Traffic Conditions**: Self-driving cars can alleviate traffic congestion, reducing commute times in high-traffic areas and minimizing gasoline waste.\n",
       "* **Enhanced Urban Mobility**: This technology can enable larger cities to provide better transportation for their residents.\n",
       "* **Economic Benefits**: The potential reduction in the need for driver's licenses could lead to decreased taxes.\n",

       "* **Affordability**: Self-driving cars may not be accessible to low-income individuals, at least initially.\n",
       "* **Mixed Integration Risks**: Without universal adoption, there will still be losses in lives, time, and costs.\n",
       "* **Job Market Impact**: A significant number of jobs in freight transportation and taxi services could be lost, potentially negatively impacting the unemployment rate and economy.\n",
       "* **Technical Vulnerabilities**: Severe weather conditions, like heavy rain, can damage the laser sensors on self-driving cars.\n",
       "* **Driver Skill Degradation**: Over-reliance on self-driving cars might lead to a decline in driving skills among humans, potentially affecting their ability to operate other vehicles like boats or motorcycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "After thoroughly examining the topic, I firmly believe that the benefits of integrating self-driving cars into today's society outweigh the drawbacks. The technology has made leaps in mechanics, accuracy, and algorithm since its inception. Notably, autonomous vehicles are projected to save tens of thousands of lives annually, with the potential to reduce traffic fatalities by 90% upon full deployment, as suggested by McKinsey & Company in 2015. Given the staggering number of motor vehicle crash deaths in 2016 (over 37,000, as per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), self-driving cars present the most viable solution to decreasing such fatalities. Additionally, they can lead to reduced police activity, thereby minimizing traffic stops—a significant advantage in preventing unnecessary confrontations between law enforcement and drivers.\n",

Google is one company that continuously strives to answer that call. Recently they have been doing so by researching the technology for and beginning to create self-driving cars. While this may sound like some futuristic fabrication from Back to the Future, the technology is actually here and being tested even as this piece is being written. This new technology is exciting and has the potential to improve how we travel. It also comes with some serious drawbacks and limitations that must be considered before self-driving cars become utilized at a high rate. \n",
       "\tSelf-driving cars would drastically change our mobility. Human error accounts for about 81 percent of car accidents; if everyone were to transition to self-drivings cars, human error would, theoretically, be eliminated and accidents would be projected to drastically decrease. Traffic patterns themselves would change. The technology in the car would be able to detect its proximity to other cars and adjust its speed and positioning accordingly, making roadways more efficient. Speed limits could increase since the technology in the cars would have the capacity to calculate a safe velocity and adjust the speed accordingly leading to reduced commute times. \n",
       "         One of the most attractive aspects of a self-driving car is the convenience that it provides. The New York Times has suggested that these cars would be a great asset to individuals with disabilities; instead of relying on public transportation they would be able to operate their car as anyone else would. These cars would also be an asset to an individual who wants to get work done in the time it takes to make their commute; they could safely work on a laptop or hold a conversation without having to worry about driving. Running late for a meeting and worried about parking? Not a problem! Self-driving cars would also be able to self-park allowing you to pull up right to the curb and not have to frantically find a parking spot. \n",
       "\tAt this point you're thinking, 'this seems great, sign me up!', right? Well, you might want to re-consider. Self-driving cars sound great in theory but when thinking through their practical applications one runs into several road blocks (pun intended). Consider this. A person gets into their car while intoxicated. This shouldn't be a problem because the car can simply drive itself; the individual can safely ride in the car without endangering themself or others through reckless driving. The car comes upon a traffic signal that is not operating correctly and there is a traffic cop directly the flow of cars. The self-driving car is not equipped to deal with human signals: it does not have human judgement. Instead of being able to over-ride the autonomic function of the car the individual is incapacitated and so the car speeds through the signal resulting in an accident where several people are injured. Who is at fault? The intoxicated individual? The car? The other cars involved? The answer is not clear here but the result is the same as if an intoxicated individual had chosen to get behind the wheel and manually drive the car. \n",
       "\tHumans are not perfect. But then again, neither is technology. Both may have the ability to drive a car but is one really better than the other? My response would be no. A self-driving car is an amazing feat of technology. It is a tool that can be used for many positive purposes and has the potential to change the way in which humans travel. But self-driving cars should only be that: a tool. The technology that drives these cars has the ability to fail such as in the scenario I described above as well as through security breaches or simple technology glitches. All scenarios must be thoroughly researched and discussed prior to the mass-production of this technology. The technology has to be made simply enough so that, in the event of a glitch, a person can manually operate the vehicle. At the same time, it needs to be complex enough so that hacker's cannot readily hijack the technology and take control of the car. \n",
       "        Does this mean that research on and manufacturing of self-driving cars should be halted or terminated? Of course not! New technology gives us the ability to improve our quality of life. If self-driving cars were to be utilized in mass, there would be a myriad of benefits that should not be overlooked. Prior to the adoption of mass-production, we must be careful to define the role that human's will play while inside the vehicles. Humans should still retain the capacity to manually drive a car should the technology glitch and fail both for the safety of the driver and the safety of others. Ultimately, if you choose to get into a car whether or not you are the one driving, you should have the ability to take control of the vehicle - or at least maintain an awareness of your surroundings in the event you have to make spur of the moment decisions while on the road. \n",
       "\tThankfully, we have time to carefully think through all sides of the self-driving car conversation before they are able to be mass produced. Currently, the price of the cars are astronomically high: over $100,000! With only the one percent of society being able to afford them we don't have to worry too much about how these cars will change our current transportation system. However, the sooner these topics are discussed the easier it will be to resolve potential problems that arise regarding these cars in the future. Self-driving cars are a testament to how far technology has come.

For instance, consider a scenario where an intoxicated individual relies on a self-driving car but encounters a malfunctioning traffic signal managed by a police officer. The car, lacking human judgment, might proceed through the signal, causing an accident. This raises complex questions about liability.\n",

While self-driving cars are technological marvels with the potential to positively transform travel, they should be viewed as tools, not replacements for human oversight. The technology's susceptibility to failure, security breaches, and glitches necessitates thorough research and discussion before mass production.

How do the self-driving cars interact with cars operated by humans? Even if tests with multiple autonomous cars have positive results, adding in external factors like human drivers, unpredictable pedestrians or unforeseen weather could present scenarios that are not programmed into the cars' intelligence. In other words, there will always be new ways to outsmart \"smart\" cars. \n",
       "\tIn addition to this new technology being dangerous for everyone involved, and even those that aren't, it would also be very expensive to implement.

       "\tSelf-driving cars offer a lot of freedom to the drivers to do other tasks while commuting. Accidents due to drunk-driving will be a past. Disabled people will not have to depend on anyone else to commute. Owing to their platooning behavior and complex algorithms to control the distance between two cars, it is believed that self-driving cars will reduce the occurrence of road accidents. Although self-driving cars offer so many advantages, there are numerous disadvantages as well. With the new self-driving technology, unemployment rates will rise, the gasoline industry will be hit. These cars are bound to expensive and there are high chances of technology failure imposing risk of accidents to occur. \n",

       "\tOne main reason that makes self-driving cars unsafe is the unforeseen failure of technology. Self-driving cars work completely on computer technology, sensors and GPS tracking. In a situation of technical failure, there is a high risk for accidents to occur. Technical failure occurs when the sensors do not function or there is no internet connectivity etc. Non-functioning sensors will not signal the car to stop in the presence of an obstacle. This might lead to a huge accident especially when the car is at a high speed. \n",
       "\tAlso, the GPS is not always accurate. For example, in a city named Pittsburgh, there are numerous GPS trackers on staircases which are detected as the shortest route. If your car follows the shortest path shown by GPS, it might end up rolling down the staircase, thus leading to an accident. Unless the computer knows about the presence of such pseudo roads, you will not be able to avoid this situation. Thus we can see that with all such instances, self-driven cars are not always as safe as they are expected to be. \n",

       "\tThose who are the expert in driving also get into false confidence and do take it casually sometimes while driving. Moreover increasing amount of stress and getting engaged in alcohol, drugs among the young generation is common nowadays. All these results in distractions while driving and thus increases the number of road accidents. \n",
       "\tSelf-driving cars can bring a positive change in this direction by ensuring safe and fully focused driving each and every time and thus reducing the number of road accidents. A computer works in the same way behind the steering, every time it drives and is not affected by the external distractions nor it is overconfident at any point. Every time it drives, it will take the same precautions and drive with as much safety as the first time. Additionally, it learns from the mistake of others and keeps improving as it collects all these data to take further decisions. \n",
       "\tWhile commuting to work, most of the people have their mind occupied over the deadlines they have to complete or their performance in corporate and social life. In such cases, breaking traffic rules or getting distracted while driving is quite common.

Unlike humans, computers behind the wheel are immune to external distractions, overconfidence, and emotional influences. They maintain a uniform level of caution, learn from collective data, and improve with each drive.\n",
       "During daily commutes, many individuals are preoccupied with work deadlines and personal concerns, often leading to reckless driving. With computers at the helm, this issue dissolves, allowing people to productively utilize their time while traveling, thus saving lives and reducing accidents.\n",

Self-driving cars in theory are a wonderful thing; You would save so much time that you would have spent driving, and there wouldn't be any human error that leads to the numerous accidents that we hear about on a yearly basis. However, now that they are in active development, what's the consensus? What do people think? While there are definitely some who are against self-driving cars, I am in favor of working on them for their potential contribution to major computer science problems, the amount of time that could be used for things other than driving, and that while the problems that are plaguing the self-driving car problem are problems now, they won't be in the future with sufficiently advanced technology. \n",
       "\tThe interesting thing about Self Driving Cars is that their greatest strengths also serve as great weaknesses. If we were to talk about the pros of self-driving cars, it would easily be that they remove all risk that a human driver would bring to the table. They would have perfect control of the car, removing all risks of drunk driving or some irregular movement on the part of the driver. If done right, self-driving cars could remove all human error from driving and save many lives that would've been lost to vehicle related incidents. \n",
       "\tThat being said, removing the human from the equation isn't a viable solution, especially at this point in the development cycle for self-driving cars. Without the human, you no longer have any cognitive judgement regarding driver safety. Cars may determine to use the most efficient road rather than the one safest for the passengers. Cars may also not be able to function in bad weather, as heavy precipitation could result in damage to integral sensors needed for the self-driving functionality. The cars may not be able to recognize things human could (human turn signals for example). Removing the human removes all of the risk of a human driver, but also all of the potential problem solving that humans could perform in an emergency behind the wheel. \n",
       "\tWith those valid problems being reasonable concerns, I am in favor of self-driving cars. Aside from the fact that I don't think I'm a good driver (I'm probably not), I believe that working on the self-driving car problem goes a long way in solving many problems in Computer Science. An example is that a self-driving car would need to be able to have a car recognize other cars, measure distance, discern road hazards, etc. This requires a very advance Computer Vision system to be able to work. A car would also need to have an advanced machine learning model in order to discern driver etiquette, such as stopping for children stepping off of a school bus, yielding to ambulances, etc. Lots of Computer Science problems are making progress and will continue to make progress due to working on self-driving cars. As a computer scientist, self-driving cars are a very exciting field, and I will hopefully be able to continue watching it grow.\n",
       "\tLet's now look at the concept of self-driving cars from a convenience perspective. Let's face it, most humans are either lazy, or they want to work as much as possible. In this regard, self-driving cars are capable of enabling both of these options. First of all, let's consider when a human is feeling lazy. In this case, the human can save lots of effort by not having to drive between destinations. The human is free to do other tasks (i.e. sleeping), while the car is responsible for transporting the human to their desired location. This ties in directly with the next case, which is when a human wants be as productive as possible. If a car is capable of driving itself to wherever the human wishes to go, then the human now has some extra time on their hands to make a phone call, read some documents for work, etc. The time the human saves due to the self-driving car is now time the human can use to get something done.\n",
       "\tLastly, I believe that all of the problems that are attributed to self driving cars will not be an issue in the future. Leaving all talk of the Computer Science issues aside (I covered that two paragraphs ago), let's look at some of the other issues that people have with self-driving cars. One problem is that people don't want to hand over control to a computer because they can't trust them. In my opinion, this problem is something that most humans have had to deal with for quite some time in other aspects of life. I'm sure when the elevator was first introduced, people avoided it in favor of stairs. As a technology matures, so does the reliability attributed to it. Another issue that the public brings up is the issue of cost. Self-driving cars are expensive. This too will come down as manufacturing becomes more efficient and prices for materials drop (computers now are worth around as much as they used to years ago, and computers nowadays are much more advanced). I believe that most problems that are attributed with self-driving cars now will either disappear or become irrelevant in the future after the technology matures, costs decrease and the market matures.\n",
       "\tI support self-driving cars, and think they are leading the way towards a better future. I'm personally looking forward to a future where I can read books or play video games on the road while my car takes care of all of the driving. I'm looking forward to other areas of my life being enriched due to research that was done for the sake of self driving cars (hopefully video game AI could become more advanced as a result). Lastly, I'm looking forward to laughing with people who used to be skeptic about  self-driving technology, but have adopted it completely after it became viable. I think self-driving cars are and will later be beneficial to society.</td>\n",

       "The concept of self-driving cars, once a product of imagination, is now a reality in development, presenting both promise and potential pitfalls if not handled judiciously. In theory, self-driving cars offer numerous benefits, including significant time savings and the elimination of human error, a leading cause of accidents. As development progresses, public opinion is divided, with some expressing concerns. I, however, support the development of self-driving cars, citing their potential to address major computer science challenges, offer unparalleled convenience, and ultimately, save lives, despite current limitations.\n",
       "\n",
       "A notable aspect of self-driving cars is the dual nature of their strengths and weaknesses. On one hand, they remove the risk of human error, including drunk driving and erratic behavior, potentially saving countless lives if perfected. However, this removal of human judgment also introduces vulnerabilities, such as the reliance on technology that may not always select the safest route or function optimally in adverse weather conditions. Moreover, self-driving cars may struggle to replicate human problem-solving in emergencies or recognize subtle cues like hand signals.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these challenges, I believe the benefits of developing self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks. Beyond personal convenience, working on this technology propels advancements in computer science, notably in advanced computer vision (for recognizing vehicles, measuring distances, and identifying road hazards) and machine learning (for understanding driver etiquette, such as yielding to emergency vehicles). These advancements have far-reaching implications beyond transportation.\n",
       "\n",
       "From a convenience standpoint, self-driving cars cater to both the desire for leisure and the pursuit of productivity. For the former, they offer a hands-free commute, allowing for rest or entertainment. For the latter, they provide additional time for work-related tasks, enhancing overall productivity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, I posit that the current hurdles facing self-driving cars—ranging from trust issues to high costs—will diminish as the technology matures. Historical precedents, such as the adoption of elevators, demonstrate that reliability concerns wane with time. Similarly, as manufacturing efficiency improves and material costs decrease, the expense associated with self-driving cars will become more manageable.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, I firmly support self-driving cars, envisioning a future where they not only transform transportation but also enrich other aspects of life through the advancements they drive in technology. Whether it's enjoying leisure activities during commutes or benefiting from the trickle-down effects of research in AI, I believe self-driving cars are a stepping stone towards a more convenient, safer, and technologically advanced society.@</td>\n",

Nowadays, these developers are focusing their attention onto cars. With cars being one of the most common modes of transportation in the United States, people use them nearly every day. With the introduction of self-driving cars, the time spent driving everyday can be used for productive tasks. The tasks that would once be a distraction to the driver would become their primary focus as the car handles all of the driving.

       "\tI actually have firsthand experience with a car equipped with simple self-driving capabilities. In April my parents and I were in Florida visiting my grandparents. We had a rental car and my father was driving on the highway. A car in front of us was going far below the speed limit, so he punched the accelerator in order to pass it. The rental car’s computer determined that he must have meant to hit the brakes and hit the accelerator by mistake. So, the car suddenly locked up on the busy highway and stopped, causing all passengers to be thrown forward and the car behind us to nearly rear-end us. This “feature” is just a taste of what interacting with entirely self-driving cars would be like. Self-driving cars have been programmed to act as if they drive better than humans when this is rarely the case.\n",
       "\tAutonomous vehicles also pose great risks regarding security and their ability to interact with other drivers. According to the Guardian, self-driving cars’ computers would be targets for hackers. There are so many situations where a self-driving car could be led to cause accidents, especially if the human behind the wheel has never learned to drive or is too distracted or trusting in the vehicle’s technology to intervene. A simple idea is that a hacker can encourage the cars to engage in a platooning pattern (where the cars line up closely behind each other like train cars), at which point the cars would be like a line of little ducklings ready to do the bidding of Mother Duck, leading them off the road or suddenly slamming on the brakes when the cars are very close and traveling at high speeds. These issues render self-driving cars dangers not only for their passengers but also for everyone else on the road, with or without their consent.\n",
       "\tMany proponents of self-driving cars act on the assumption that vehicle computers have an understanding of the environment around them, and in fact would be even more aware than a distracted human would be. Sure, if they have the right sensors they can calculate the speeds of nearby cars, and they probably would monitor weather conditions and other environmental hazards. But in terms of anticipating the behavior of other drivers, they fall short. When I drive, I can look at other vehicles and anticipate their behavior. This driver is turned around looking at their kid in the backseat. This person’s truck has tree branches in the back that aren’t tied down. This person’s car has been rear-ended several times and the bumper is being held on with duct tape. Each of these pieces of information influences what I expect the driver to act like. A computer isn’t going to look at its surroundings and judge everything like this. As such, a computer will not be as well-informed or adaptive as humans, because we will never be able to prepare it for all the different drivers that it would need to be ready to judge. \n",
       "\tOverall, much of the discrepancy between human- and self-driven cars is due to the fact that computers are not endowed with the ability to be truly conscious and can be easily mislead or misinformed. To me, the negatives and dangers that we know for certain will happen with a self-driving car far outweigh the possible and hypothetical benefits.</td>\n",

       "Self-driving cars spark intense debates in the tech world, with proponents highlighting potential benefits like reduced accidents, increased mobility for the disabled and elderly, and liberated driver time. Conversely, skeptics, including myself, worry about computers' limited decision-making, heightened security risks, and increased vehicle failure potential. My stance stems from the fundamental gap between human and computer understanding of the world.\n",

       "**Personal Experience: A Cautionary Tale**\n",
       "In April, I encountered a rental car with basic self-driving features in Florida. While my father attempted to pass a slow vehicle on the highway, the car's computer misinterpreted his acceleration as a mistaken brake press, abruptly stopping the car and nearly causing a rear-end collision. This incident illustrates the pitfalls of relying on self-driving cars, which are programmed to drive \"better\" than humans, often without justification.\n",

       "**Security Risks and Inter-driver Interactions**\n",
       "Autonomous vehicles pose significant security threats, as highlighted by The Guardian, which notes that self-driving cars' computers are vulnerable to hacking. A hacked car could be manipulated into causing accidents, especially if the human operator is inexperienced or distracted. For instance, a hacker could induce a platooning pattern, leading to a procession of cars that can be remotely controlled to veer off the road or slam on the brakes at high speeds, endangering all road users.\n",

       "**The Limits of Computer Environmental Awareness**\n",
       "Proponents often assume that self-driving cars possess a deeper understanding of their surroundings, surpassing that of distracted humans. While equipped sensors can track nearby car speeds and monitor weather conditions, computers fall short in anticipating driver behavior. As a human driver, I can observe and adapt to other vehicles, taking into account subtle cues like a driver's inattention or a vehicle's evident disrepair. Computers lack this capacity for nuanced judgment, as they cannot be prepared for the vast array of drivers they may encounter.\n",

       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "The disparity between human and self-driven cars stems from the inherent limitations of computer consciousness, making them prone to misdirection and misinformation. In my opinion, the confirmed drawbacks and dangers of self-driving cars outweigh the speculative benefits, rendering them a perilous proposition for the foreseeable future. @</td>\n",
