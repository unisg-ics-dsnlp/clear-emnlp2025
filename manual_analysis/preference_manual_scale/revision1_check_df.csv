"Today's world is punctuated by new innovations and technologies being released every day. An intriguing one that is generating equal interest and consternation across the United States is the technology of self-driving cars. Supporters of self-driving cars note that it would improve fuel efficiency and drive down gasoline costs to consumers, that it would dramatically reduce car-related morbidity and mortality, and that it would allow disabled and elderly individuals independence and the ability to travel freely unlike they could before. However on the opposite side of things, self-driving cars pose new risks and concerns as well. Concerns about them include their inability to operate in adverse weather conditions, their inability to handle unique road conditions and human traffic signals when mechanical traffic signals aren't present, the high cost associated with the vehicles, and the general wariness that many consumers have for self-driving cars and if the technology would ever even be widely accepted enough for use.

Personally, I find the benefits to self-driving cars vastly outweigh the negative factors. Self-driving cars provide a safe, efficient platform that can reduce motor vehicle accident associated fatalities and injuries significantly, reduce the time of commutes and the cost associated with extended periods of driving, and allows people who aren't able to drive such as the disabled and elderly a newfound freedom that so many who have access to cars take for granted. The cost of human life that can be saved is alone the best supporting reason for self driving cars. It has been reported that up to 81% of motor vehicle accidents are due to human error, and this could be completely mitigated by computers who don't have the capability to be distracted, tired, drunk, or any other factor that reduces a human's ability to drive safely. By taking the human factor out of driving, countless lives and debilitating injuries can be prevented with self-driving cars. Additionally, self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionize traffic patterns via their ability to ""platoon"" where they drive in coordinated packs together. This coordination allows more cars to be on the road as they can drive closer together in a safer manner than humans ever could, It also removes the human inefficiency of driving that causes traffic jams and congestion and would therefore reduce commute times and optimize fuel efficiency to save consumers more money on gasoline. And lastly comes the ability of self-cars to substantially improve the lives of society's least mobile individuals such as the elderly and disabled by granting them newfound independence. Many of us who can walk, drive, and see, etc normally take for granted our ability to move and don't realize how dramatically self-driving cars can improve their lives. No longer would they have to wait for public access transit vans that are known for being slow and extremely limited in hours and range.

Of course however, there are negative factors to self-driving cars that are valid and warrant important consideration as well. Opponents to self-driving cars note that the technology just isn't ready yet, self-driving cars still can't handle poor weather conditions such as heavy rain, they cannot accommodate for human traffic signals when regular traffic signals fail, and that there is still a general opposition to the idea of drivers relinquishing control of their cars to a computer which could potentially put them in dangerous situations. However, many of these concerns can be remedied with time and further development. As the technology matures and barriers are hurdled, these risks will be mitigated and self-driving cars can progressively become widely accepted.","

Today's world is marked by rapid innovation, with self-driving cars being a particularly intriguing technology sparking both interest and concern across the United States. Proponents argue that self-driving cars will enhance fuel efficiency, reduce gasoline costs, drastically lower car-related fatalities and injuries, and empower disabled and elderly individuals with unprecedented independence. Conversely, concerns include operational limitations in adverse weather, unique road conditions, and non-mechanical traffic signals, high vehicle costs, and consumer wariness about adopting the technology.

Personally, I firmly believe the benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the drawbacks. These vehicles offer a safe, efficient platform that can significantly reduce motor vehicle accident-related fatalities and injuries, cut commute times and associated costs, and grant the disabled and elderly a newfound freedom often taken for granted by able-bodied individuals. The potential to save lives alone is a compelling reason; with up to 81% of motor vehicle accidents attributed to human error, computers—unaffected by distractions, fatigue, or intoxication—can mitigate this risk. By removing the human factor, self-driving cars can prevent countless fatalities and debilitating injuries. Furthermore, they have the potential to revolutionize traffic through ""platooning,"" allowing more cars to safely share the road, reducing commute times, and optimizing fuel efficiency to save consumers money.

Moreover, self-driving cars can substantially enhance the lives of the elderly and disabled by providing independence. For those who can drive, walk, or see without issue, it's easy to overlook the profound impact self-driving cars can have on the less mobile, who no longer have to rely on limited and slow public access transit vans.

While valid concerns exist, such as the technology's current limitations in poor weather, handling human traffic signals, and public apprehension about relinquishing control, these can be addressed through time and development. As the technology matures and overcomes its hurdles, these risks will diminish, paving the way for widespread acceptance of self-driving cars.

"The idea of having self driving cars may have seemed far away into the future until now. Or is it. The initial reaction would be to love the new, innovative idea. However, every time technology introduces a revolutionary invention, it is always met with various critical drawbacks. If possible, self-driving cars could lower car accidents and drunk driving with the use of computer algorithms, reduce traffic, and create higher speed limits through computer operations. But, this would have worse results. In this recent debate, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages because of the potential risks in the future. 

First, the creation of self driving cars would cause unemployment in the transportation sector. Not only will taxi drivers, bus drivers, car instructors, workers, and personal injury lawyers lose their jobs, but also the gasoline industry and auto manufacturers. America cannot afford to risk losing two of the biggest industries that create large amounts of revenue. On top of that, self driving cars would be not be consumer friendly. The average American citizen would not be able to purchase one of these cars because of the high cost. The engineering, software, sensors, and power/computer requirements itself costs $100,000. However, proponents of the new innovation still say that the solution to cities that have inadequate public transportation is self driving cars. This is a clear misconception because public transportation would cease to exist and people would not be able to afford the new cars. Ultimately, the adoption of self driving cars is a bad choice that will negatively affect the workers and economy. 

Another huge risk is security and safety. Implementing computers in cars would bring all the vulnerabilities of the computer with it. Because extensive amounts of information must be stored in the computers for the car to operate, issues regarding identity theft is unavoidable. Personal data in the software such as bank account information could be stolen by hackers. This issue also brings up a safety hazard because self driving cars are only suited for the perfect scenario and deemed to technological failures. In bad weather situations such as heavy rain and snow, laser sensors will fail. In addition, self driving cars would have a hard time driving through hazards, detours, accidents, and on roads of different areas because of the road laws in each state. Although the use of GPS maps have aided a lot of drivers today, there are times where the directions are inaccurate. Since self driving cars rely on the GPS, there is a possibility in which cars could take dangerous turns off the road. 

In a perfect society, self driving cars can definitely exist. In our world today, America is far from it. Only if there are no flaws and testings come out perfect, will there be a serious discussion of overhauling the automobile industry. But, it seems foolish to implement this now. Promise and opportunity is not enough to fully adopt self driving cars.","

The notion of self-driving cars, once deemed a distant future concept, has rapidly become a tangible reality. While the initial allure of innovation is enticing, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant drawbacks that accompany such revolutionary technology. Proponents argue that self-driving cars could utilize computer algorithms to reduce car accidents, drunk driving, traffic congestion, and potentially increase speed limits. However, a thorough examination reveals that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages due to substantial risks.

**Economic and Employment Concerns**

The introduction of self-driving cars would precipitate widespread unemployment in the transportation sector, affecting not only taxi drivers, bus drivers, and car instructors but also the gasoline industry and auto manufacturers. This would jeopardize two of America's most lucrative industries, posing an unacceptable risk to the economy. Furthermore, the exorbitant cost of self-driving cars (estimated at $100,000 due to advanced engineering, software, sensors, and computer requirements) renders them inaccessible to the average American citizen. Contrary to proponents' claims, self-driving cars are not a viable solution for cities with inadequate public transportation, as this would likely lead to the demise of public transportation systems, further exacerbating affordability issues.

**Security and Safety Risks**

Integrating computers into vehicles introduces inherent vulnerabilities, including the potential for identity theft due to the extensive personal data (e.g., bank account information) stored in the software. This poses a significant safety hazard, as self-driving cars are designed for ideal scenarios and are susceptible to technological failures. Inclement weather conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, can incapacitate laser sensors. Additionally, navigating through hazards, detours, accidents, and complying with varying road laws across different states would pose considerable challenges. The reliance on GPS, which can sometimes provide inaccurate directions, further increases the risk of vehicles taking dangerous detours.

**Conclusion**

While self-driving cars might thrive in a flawless, hypothetical society, the United States is far from achieving such a scenario. Given the numerous, unresolved flaws and the need for flawless testing, it is premature to consider overhauling the automobile industry. Promise and opportunity alone are insufficient justifications for the widespread adoption of self-driving cars at this juncture.

"According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, nearly 81% of vehicular accidents occur as a direct result of human error. In recent years, this has caused many people to question whether self-driving technology can eliminate this risk- potentially saving countless lives. Other argue that entrusting human lives to technology will not suffice. However, it is crucial to understand the pros and cons of self-driving vehicles in order to make an informed decision as to whether they will benefit our society.
         First and foremost, self-driving technology virtually eradicates the risk of a vehicular accident caused by human error. Less accidents will result in public institutions, predominantly healthcare and insurance companies, saving money. Even further, public safety officials and law enforcement officers will spend less time dealing with car accidents. This will enable them to shift their focus towards more serious crimes, therefore keeping local communities a more safe environment for everyone. Along with this, many people value the personal time they will save with self-driving vehicles. Without having to focus on navigating the roads, passengers are encouraged to accomplish more behind the wheel than every before.
        Despite the numerous positive aspects of self-driving vehicles, many argue that this technology will not be beneficial to society. To begin, both the time and cost associated with teaching people to utilized the technology itself is inconceivable. Coinciding with this is the cost to manufacture the technology that makes purchasing it difficult for even middle class citizens. As many people would not have access to the technology for many years, if at all, vehicular accidents as a result of human error will still occur on roadways. 
     Although many believe that self-driving technology will catapult society into the future, I find that it will do just the opposite. Self-driving vehicles will be virtually inaccessible to the masses. Furthermore, if the technology fails, other drivers are put at risk. It can be argued that the time saved behind the wheel will be worth this risk, but, is encouraging laziness worthy goal to strive after? Self-driving technology promotes a decline in human-interaction and self- sufficiency as drivers would no longer be held accountable for their vehicles. 
       Conclusively, self-driving vehicles hold more uncertainty than promise for the future of society. Although time and money may be saved initially in minute amounts, the long term prosperity of this technology is not promising. So, next time you are sitting behind the wheel of your car, think about whether or not you’d entrust your life and the lives of those you love to technology. Would you?","

"The reading provides readers with several straightforward explanations in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. The beneficial side introduces the higher possibility of lower accidents due to limited human errors by applying computer systems in cars, the time efficiency from the drivers' perspective, the convenience for disabled population, and smoother traffic. However, the opposing side points out several serious issues, such as violation of privacy, unemployment, and inefficiency under severe weather. I hold the disagreement toward the pro-side and believe that self-driving cars may pose unavoidable threats to the overall well-being of the society. I construct my arguments from the stances of safety, privacy protection, and employment. 

To start with, it may be the fact that human errors cause more frequent and severer accidents than mechanical malfunctions. But how can we safely assume that once computer systems take fully control of the vehicle, and that could eliminate mechanical errors? In particular, cars may contain mechanical defects by construction, computer system built in the car may barely notice or detect any of the manufacturing issues, let alone of reducing accidents in the driving practice. Furthermore, driver or passenger may still play an important role in the driving process since people have to give commands to the computer system in the car. What if people make mistakes or push the system to perform personal choices? Accidents may still be possible under such contexts. New risks and dangers thus deteriorate the smooth function of the society.  

Second, computer in a car needs to acquire as many information as possible to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the driving decisions. This car automatically collects information from all others, and if criminals make full use of this function, they can escape from detection or police chase by flawlessly escaping by a car built with computer tracking system. In such a case, the privacy of police officers has been violated. But if police can override all the cars systems, will that be fair to citizens? Before self-driving car serves disruptively for the society, several moral issues in terms of privacy protection should be considered and hopefully solved.

Third, professional drivers lose jobs if computer system is the only approved driver for all cars. So do the relevant sectors including car insurance companies, and traffic guiding officers. And how should we deal with this dramatic change when suddenly unemployment impairs the stability of the society? New skills are needed, and new supporting sectors can emerge. But public institutions and government have to get prepared for the transition for its people which can be time-consuming and is possible to lead to unsatisfied outcomes.

In summary, self-driving cars as a type of innovation certainly will promote the industrial change of a society. However, we cannot assume that any innovation dramatically benefits the development of the society. Based on current technology and legal situations, self-driving cars may not be as beneficial as imagined. And we should be cautious for approving such changes in our society.","

The reading presents a comprehensive overview of the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. While proponents highlight the potential for reduced accidents due to minimized human error, increased time efficiency, convenience for the disabled, and smoother traffic, opponents raise concerns about privacy violations, unemployment, and inefficiency in severe weather. I disagree with the pro-side, believing that self-driving cars pose significant threats to societal well-being. My arguments center around safety, privacy protection, and employment.

**Safety Concerns:**
Although human error is a leading cause of accidents, it's overly optimistic to assume that computer-controlled vehicles will eliminate mechanical errors. Cars may still have manufacturing defects that onboard computer systems might not detect, and human input, required for command-giving, can introduce new error possibilities. This interplay of human and machine can lead to novel risks, undermining societal stability.

**Privacy Protection:**
To optimize driving decisions, in-car computers collect vast amounts of data, potentially exposing individuals to privacy violations if exploited by criminals. For instance, police officers' privacy could be compromised if suspects utilize computer-tracked cars to evade detection. Before integrating self-driving cars, we must address these moral dilemmas and establish fair, privacy-protective protocols, especially considering the implications of law enforcement overrides on citizen rights.

**Employment Implications:**
The reliance on computer systems as sole drivers would lead to widespread job losses among professional drivers, as well as in related sectors like car insurance and traffic guidance. Managing this transition, which could destabilize society, requires significant preparatory efforts from public institutions and governments to upskill the workforce and foster new, supportive industries. This process is time-consuming and may yield unsatisfactory outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
While self-driving cars represent a potential catalyst for industrial change, we should not assume that innovation inherently benefits societal development. Given current technological and legal landscapes, self-driving cars may not offer the anticipated advantages. Therefore, we must exercise caution when considering the integration of such transformative technologies into our society. ",draft1_2018argrewrite_47.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"

This process is time-consuming and may yield unsatisfactory outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
While self-driving cars represent a potential catalyst for industrial change, we should not assume that innovation inherently benefits societal development. Given current technological and legal landscapes, self-driving cars may not offer the anticipated advantages. Therefore, we must exercise caution when considering the integration of such transformative technologies into our society. ","The reading provides readers with several straightforward explanations in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. The beneficial side introduces the higher possibility of lower accidents due to limited human errors by applying computer systems in cars, the time efficiency from the drivers' perspective, the convenience for disabled population, and smoother traffic. However, the opposing side points out several serious issues, such as violation of privacy, unemployment, and inefficiency under severe weather. I hold the disagreement toward the pro-side and believe that self-driving cars may pose unavoidable threats to the overall well-being of the society. I construct my arguments from the stances of safety, privacy protection, and employment. 

To start with, it may be the fact that human errors cause more frequent and severer accidents than mechanical malfunctions. But how can we safely assume that once computer systems take fully control of the vehicle, and that could eliminate mechanical errors? In particular, cars may contain mechanical defects by construction, computer system built in the car may barely notice or detect any of the manufacturing issues, let alone of reducing accidents in the driving practice. Furthermore, driver or passenger may still play an important role in the driving process since people have to give commands to the computer system in the car. What if people make mistakes or push the system to perform personal choices? Accidents may still be possible under such contexts. New risks and dangers thus deteriorate the smooth function of the society.  

Second, computer in a car needs to acquire as many information as possible to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the driving decisions. This car automatically collects information from all others, and if criminals make full use of this function, they can escape from detection or police chase by flawlessly escaping by a car built with computer tracking system. In such a case, the privacy of police officers has been violated. But if police can override all the cars systems, will that be fair to citizens? Before self-driving car serves disruptively for the society, several moral issues in terms of privacy protection should be considered and hopefully solved.

Third, professional drivers lose jobs if computer system is the only approved driver for all cars. So do the relevant sectors including car insurance companies, and traffic guiding officers. And how should we deal with this dramatic change when suddenly unemployment impairs the stability of the society? New skills are needed, and new supporting sectors can emerge. But public institutions and government have to get prepared for the transition for its people which can be time-consuming and is possible to lead to unsatisfied outcomes.

In summary, self-driving cars as a type of innovation certainly will promote the industrial change of a society. However, we cannot assume that any innovation dramatically benefits the development of the society. Based on current technology and legal situations, self-driving cars may not be as beneficial as imagined. And we should be cautious for approving such changes in our society."
"As with the advent and introduction of any new technology, there are pros and cons that arise with the implementation of that technology. This is also true with autonomous, or self-driving, cars. With the testing of self-driving cars currently happening in several cities across the United States, the debate on whether or not autonomous cars are safer than those driven by humans has come to the forefront of the public health and wellness debate in the media. Many cars already come equipped with some of the basic technology - autonomous breaking, self-parking, or sensors that detect close objects, so we may be closer to the future than we think.

There are several pros for the use of self-driving cars, and one of the biggest is safety. While a small percentage of car accidents could be caused by mechanical failures, the majority are caused by a distracted driver. A computer driver would take the human element factor out of the equation and remove most of the danger just by being a computer. Computers make for the ideal driver as they will not get tired, lose their eyesight, get distracted, imbibe in drugs or alcohol, etc. Computers also use specific algorithms to calculate speed, stopping distance, and other collected information that help to dramatically decrease the chance of an accident. 

In addition to safety, there are many other positive side-effects to autonomous driving. Self-driving cars could help with traffic optimization, as the cars could communicate with each other to help identify traffic problems and their specific algorithms and sensors could help to reduce commute times while also allowing more cars on the road with less traffic. People with disabilities would have more options at their disposal. Police could focus less time on traffic stops and more time on other crimes. People would have more time to do other thigns with less parking and DMV headaches for drivers. The benefits are endless. 

With all the good things that come with technology, there are bound to be some bad things, as well. One of the biggest downfalls anticipated with self-driving cars would be their affect on the economy. Not only is the cost of implementing the new technology more expensive than most Americans can afford, it could also eliminate a lot of jobs in transportation. It is also expected that since most self-driving cars are powered by computers, that they would be electric cars, further putting a strain on the gas industry. Reliance on technology could make a driver's license, insurance, the DMV, and other driving related vendors obsolete. The benefits of self-driving cars would also depend upon more people opting into the option. 

Other downfalls to autonomous cars would be the flaws with technology itself. A computer cannot detect a road block or read human hand signals, so road construction would be an obstacle. The sensors are located on the outside of the vehicle, so severe weather can damage them. Computers attract hackers and software requires user information, so there is always a chance for breach of security. Another risk would be the technology failure where a person must take over the controls - what if it is someone that has never driven their own car before? What if the GPS goes down? How will a person be able to get to where they need to go?

While a completely autonomous driving society is probably a ways off, society certainly seems to be moving towards it. I do believe that self-driving cars would be a benefit in many ways - safety, inclusion, environment, and time/traffic - but I think we have some questions that need to be answered before we get there. While there may be jobs that are lost in transportation, there will be jobs that are created with the technology and manufacturing of these vehicles. The inclusion of people with disabilities, the elderly, and those that do not have a license is a powerful tool for those that were previously reliant on others. In my opinion, self-driving cars will get over the hump and be a part of the near future, at least in a small realm.","

As the world welcomes the emergence of new technologies, the introduction of autonomous, or self-driving, cars sparks a debate on their safety compared to human-driven vehicles.

"Car accidents have been a major problem in the United States for decades. Centers for Disease Control states that fatalities from traffic incidents happen on an annual basis upwards of 33,000 people. In previous years, many researchers are discovering possible solutions on the issue of car accidents in the United States. One solution that is becoming very popular right now is the idea of self-driving vehicles. To many people, this seems like a great solution to eliminate car accidents, but others, like myself, are more skeptical about this idea. 

Self-driving cars may seem like a probable solution to eliminate car accidents, although there haven’t been enough tests to determine whether self-driving vehicles are truly safe and helpful with the issue. Because distraction is one of the leading causes of car accidents in America, self-driving vehicles will definitely be useful as there aren’t many opportunities for distraction.  Another good reason why self-driving vehicles could help the issue is that it can decrease drunk driving incidents, which can save many people’s lives. 

While there are many good reasons to have more self-driving vehicles, some believe that having these vehicles are not sufficient for our environment, especially because the cost of making these vehicles are very high. Another reason why it may not be a good idea to have self-driving vehicles is because they could eliminate many jobs in the transportation industry, and the gasoline industry will likely suffer as well. 

If more self-driving cars are prevalent, this could mean that many of us will rely more on this technology, which could lead to the inability of operating any motor vehicles. This can be very dangerous on the road because if the car were to have any type of malfunction and the driver has limited knowledge on how to operate a vehicle, this could lead to an accident.

There are many solutions to eliminate car accidents, and in my opinion, a self-driving vehicle is not one of them. It is not wise to put so much money into something that does not guarantee safety for our environment. Having these types of vehicles is also not worth taking away people’s jobs. It is also not worth putting risking people’s lives, especially for those who live in areas that snow or rain very frequently, because these computer-based cars are incapable of operating at a high level of safety in certain weather conditions. Having a self-driving vehicle may seem like a good idea for right now, but if we do see more of these cars in the future, we need to consider how this advanced technology will interact with human drivers and the wider driving environment.","

Car accidents have plagued the United States for decades, with the Centers for Disease Control reporting over 33,000 annual fatalities from traffic incidents. In response, researchers have been exploring potential solutions, with self-driving vehicles gaining popularity as a purported answer. While some see this as a silver bullet to eliminate car accidents, I remain skeptical about its efficacy.

On one hand, self-driving cars may mitigate accidents caused by distraction, a leading factor in American car crashes, as computers are less prone to distraction. Additionally, they could significantly reduce drunk driving incidents, saving countless lives. 

On the other hand, several concerns undermine the viability of self-driving vehicles. Firstly, the exorbitant production costs raise questions about their environmental sustainability. Moreover, widespread adoption could lead to substantial job losses in the transportation and gasoline industries. 

Furthermore, increased reliance on self-driving technology may erode the public's ability to operate motor vehicles, posing a significant risk in the event of a malfunction. The driver's limited knowledge could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to accidents. This concern is particularly pertinent in areas frequently affected by snow or rain, where computer-based cars struggle to maintain a high level of safety.

In conclusion, while self-driving vehicles may offer some benefits, I firmly believe they are not a panacea for eliminating car accidents. The substantial investment required does not guarantee safety, and the potential consequences – including job losses and compromised road safety in adverse weather conditions – outweigh the potential advantages.

"As the years go by, our society, especially American society, continues to reach farther and farther into the future.  One of the up-and-coming debates of recent years is self-driving cars.  While they are still in their infancy, self-driving cars have both potential advantages and disadvantages for future use.  Some of the advantages include a reduction in motor vehicle accidents for the general population.  There are many reasons as to why this may occur.  First, there are no opportunities for a computer to become distracted while driving.  Another reason is that a computer uses several different complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and plenty of other data that would decrease the chances of a car accident dramatically.  Self-driving cars would also be beneficial for disabled individuals who mainly have to rely on public transportation or assistance to get around.  While the self-driving car has its advantages, it also has disadvantages as well.  The cost of implementing self-driving cars is tremendous and possibly too much for the individual citizen to be able to pay for.  Along with the cost, there is the implication that if self-driving cars are adopted and widely used, this could have a negative impact on public transportation that was already in existence.  For example, taxi drivers, buses, etc.  Furthermore, self-driving cars have a lot of unknowns simply because they haven't been put out for widespread use in our society.  
I think that self-driving cars, if implemented correctly would be a good thing to push society further into the future.  However, at this stage self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.  Ideally, cars that are controlled by computers could reduce accidents.  With that said, there are so many unknowns that, at this point, would not be beneficial to society.  For example, one of the cons for self-driving cars is adaptation.  It's unclear as to how self-driving cars would maneuver through roadblocks or unique local driving laws.  Computers could have difficulty identifying the different local and state rules with regard to the road.  Another issue for self-driving cars is reliability.  If I'm going to put my life in the hands of a self-driving car, personally I would need to know that it is guaranteed not to malfunction.  As of now, there's no guarantee.  The main point for the counter argument for self-driving cars being beneficial to society is that it will reduce accidents.  However, I don't see that as a strong point.  There's absolutely no guarantee that accidents will be reduced because there is no evidence that the computer in the self-driving car would be able to adapt to certain conditions that might cause an accident.  Further, isn't it a possibility for computers to still make mistakes?  With this said, while self-driving cars may be beneficial to society at some point down the road, there still needs to be a lot more testing done to ensure and fully guarantee the safety of passengers.  As of now, with so many unknown problems, self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.","

As society continues to advance, the debate around self-driving cars has gained significant attention. While still in their infancy, self-driving cars present both potential benefits and drawbacks for future adoption. 

**Advantages:**

1. **Enhanced Road Safety**: Self-driving cars can minimize motor vehicle accidents due to their inability to become distracted. Sophisticated algorithms enable precise control over stopping distances and vehicle proximity, drastically reducing accident likelihood.
2. **Increased Mobility for the Disabled**: Self-driving cars offer independence to individuals with disabilities, who currently rely heavily on public transportation or assistance.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Prohibitive Implementation Costs**: The expense of integrating self-driving cars may be too high for individual citizens, posing a significant barrier to adoption.
2. **Negative Impact on Existing Public Transportation**: Widespread adoption could lead to job losses among taxi drivers, bus operators, and other public transit workers.
3. **Uncertainty and Unaddressed Challenges**: The lack of widespread use means numerous unknowns, including how self-driving cars will navigate roadblocks, comply with varied local driving laws, and ensure reliability.

**Conclusion:**
While self-driving cars have the potential to propel society forward, their current stage of development renders them not yet beneficial. The promise of reduced accidents is overshadowed by concerns over adaptation to unique driving conditions, reliability, and the potential for computer error. Extensive testing is necessary to guarantee passenger safety. Until these issues are adequately addressed, self-driving cars remain a future aspiration rather than a present benefit to society. ",draft1_2018argrewrite_53.txt,Self-driving cars,direct,revision1,"As the years go by, our society, especially American society, continues to reach farther and farther into the future.  One of the up-and-coming debates of recent years is self-driving cars.  While they are still in their infancy, self-driving cars have both potential advantages and disadvantages for future use.  Some of the advantages include a reduction in motor vehicle accidents for the general population.  There are many reasons as to why this may occur.  First, there are no opportunities for a computer to become distracted while driving.  Another reason is that a computer uses several different complicated algorithms to determine appropriate stopping distance, distance from another vehicle, and plenty of other data that would decrease the chances of a car accident dramatically.  Self-driving cars would also be beneficial for disabled individuals who mainly have to rely on public transportation or assistance to get around.  While the self-driving car has its advantages, it also has disadvantages as well.  The cost of implementing self-driving cars is tremendous and possibly too much for the individual citizen to be able to pay for.  Along with the cost, there is the implication that if self-driving cars are adopted and widely used, this could have a negative impact on public transportation that was already in existence.  For example, taxi drivers, buses, etc.  Furthermore, self-driving cars have a lot of unknowns simply because they haven't been put out for widespread use in our society.  
I think that self-driving cars, if implemented correctly would be a good thing to push society further into the future.  However, at this stage self-driving cars are not beneficial to society.  Ideally, cars that are controlled by computers could reduce accidents.  With that said, there are so many unknowns that, at this point, would not be beneficial to society.  For example, one of the cons for self-driving cars is adaptation.  It's unclear as to how self-driving cars would maneuver through roadblocks or unique local driving laws.  Computers could have difficulty identifying the different local and state rules with regard to the road.  Another issue for self-driving cars is reliability.  If I'm going to put my life in the hands of a self-driving car, personally I would need to know that it is guaranteed not to malfunction.  As of now, there's no guarantee.  The main point for the counter argument for self-driving cars being beneficial to society is that it will reduce accidents.  However, I don't see that as a strong point.  There's absolutely no guarantee that accidents will be reduced because there is no evidence that the computer in the self-driving car would be able to adapt to certain conditions that might cause an accident.  Further, isn't it a possibility for computers to still make mistakes?  With this said, while self-driving cars may be beneficial to society at some point down the road, there still needs to be a lot more testing done to ensure and fully guarantee the safety of passengers.

"Proponents of self-driving cars point to the benefits to those who are unable to drive due to a physical or mental disability, potential elimination of urban traffic, and an overwhelming reduction in collisions, injuries, and fatalities from driver error. However, there exist many groups of self-driving skeptics: those who argue the cost of self-driving technology is out of reach except for the very wealthy, those who are concerned of the potential for software bugs and even malicious hacking, and those who are simply concerned about the psychological effects of a driver handing control over a large machine to a computer. 

Perhaps the most compelling counterargument is one from critical mass; the benefits of self-driving cars, in terms of cost, time, and lives, are only noticeable when adoption thereof is widespread enough that human drivers simply aren't a major factor. The issue here is the time it takes to reach that critical point. The cost of self-driving cars, even when tempered by economies of scale, is still significant enough to consider here.

Let's do a cost-benefit analysis: even the most hardened skeptic would have to agree that the economic cost of self-driving car adoption would be worth it to reduce the approximately 40,000 deaths due to automobiles. However, this analysis does not tell the full picture. The cost will be incurred largely up-front: businesses changing their shipping fleets to self-driving cars, manufacturers changing their workflows and machinery, and individual car-buyers purchasing a self-driving car for personal gain, rather than higher-minded societal ideals.

The benefit, however, is more tenuous. The largest benefits in speed, convenience, and safety come when the majority of cars on the road are self-driving. It is at that point that the effect of human error dramatically lowers, and the algorithms are able to navigate safely and predict how other cars on the road will drive as well. A self-driving, networked city has no need for traffic lights: the cars can simply decide among themselves when to go. But a city where only 25% of the cars are self-driving is still tied to comparatively ancient technology.

I wouldn't say that I'm taking a hard-lined stance to the negative; rather, I'm simply pragmatic about the costs and skeptical of the benefits immediately. As the cost lowers over time, the marginal benefits of individual ownership grow, and adoption of self-driving cars at that point is a no-brainer. But the incentives for adoption now are not as clear.","

Proponents of self-driving cars highlight benefits for the physically or mentally disabled, potential urban traffic elimination, and a significant reduction in collisions, injuries, and fatalities due to driver error. Conversely, skeptics raise concerns about the technology's affordability, vulnerability to software bugs and hacking, and the psychological impact of relinquishing control to a computer.

A compelling counterargument lies in the concept of critical mass: the benefits of self-driving cars in terms of cost, time, and lives saved are only substantial when adoption is widespread enough to minimize human driver factors. The time required to reach this critical point is a crucial issue, as the upfront costs of self-driving cars, despite economies of scale, remain significant.

A nuanced cost-benefit analysis is necessary. Even skeptics would agree that the economic cost of adopting self-driving cars could be justified to prevent the approximately 40,000 annual automobile-related fatalities. However, this analysis is incomplete. The costs will be incurred primarily upfront: businesses converting shipping fleets, manufacturers adapting workflows and machinery, and individuals purchasing self-driving cars for personal gain.

In contrast, the benefits are more long-term. The most substantial advantages in speed, convenience, and safety materialize when most cars on the road are self-driving, dramatically reducing human error and enabling algorithms to navigate safely and predict other cars' behavior. A fully self-driving, networked city could even render traffic lights obsolete, as cars could coordinate among themselves. However, a city with only 25% self-driving cars would still rely on relatively outdated technology.

Rather than taking a hard-lined negative stance, I adopt a pragmatic view of the current costs and a skeptical outlook on immediate benefits. As costs decrease over time, the marginal benefits of individual ownership will grow, making adoption a straightforward decision. Currently, however, the incentives for immediate adoption are less clear-cut, warranting a more measured approach.

"The discussion of the effects of self-driving cars on society may seem in the distant future, but the future is now. Self-driving cars are gaining popularity with Google and other manufacturing and software companies. As with any new technology, there are certainly reservations on the impact it would have on society as well as the positive effects. The advantages of implementing self-driving cars en masse far outweigh the potential problems associated with them. The time has come to embrace the future with open arms, and it starts with self-driving cars.
	Some common concerns with self-driving cars arise from trusting and depending on machines. If humans never have to drive again, then they would forget how to, and this would be deleterious in times of crisis or emergency. Alongside this, people fear a malfunction in software, which may lead to accidents with other cars- human, or self-driving. Another gripe with software is the immense capabilities it would have and how much personal information and data it might store. This then leads to distrust in data management and in some cases theft of this data. Humans tend to have an innate distrust of machines, and putting their lives on the line to be driven around is no exception.
	Although the aforementioned concerns with self-driving cars are valid, it should not get in the way of the progress of these incredible inventions. There are so many advantages in self-driving cars, but the biggest one may be as simple as time. Self-driving cars would be completely automated and have the potential to link up with other cars on the road and create an almost perfect traffic system where tailgating is safe, high speed travel, and pedestrian detection. Buying in to this system lets society run better, safer and quicker. In this scenario, commute times would be cut, city driving would be made easier since the car could drop one off and then find its own parking, and could save the user so much time. As if all of these reasons weren’t enough, one would have time on the commute to catch up with loved ones, safely eat, read, watch TV, and even sleep! Time is precious, and not having to divert precious attention and time to the road allows unprecedented time to the user. While people may still disagree that these are not enough to change their minds I claim that this technology may be the quicker and safer alternative to public transportation. If these people trust airplanes, trains, subways, and even motorized scooters, then they should not have a problem with self-driving cars. The future is here and this is it. Moral dilemmas and technical issues can be improved on and studied, but the precedent must exist. Let’s give self-driving cars a shot.","

Additionally, fears of software malfunctions leading to accidents, as well as concerns over data privacy and potential theft, given the vast amount of personal information these systems could store, are also prevalent. This skepticism towards machines is natural, especially when it comes to entrusting one's life.

Despite these valid concerns, they should not hinder the progress of these groundbreaking inventions. The benefits of self-driving cars are numerous, with the most significant perhaps being the gift of time. Fully automated, these vehicles could integrate with other cars to create a nearly flawless traffic system, enabling safe tailgating, high-speed travel, and enhanced pedestrian detection. Embracing this system would make society function more efficiently, safely, and quickly. Commute times would decrease, city driving would be simplified with autonomous parking, and users would save considerable time. This saved time could then be allocated to connecting with loved ones, eating, reading, watching TV, or even sleeping during commutes.
